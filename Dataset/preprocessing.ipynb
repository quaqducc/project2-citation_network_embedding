However, the critical coupling corresponds to a change of phase, and we expect it to be independent of the gauge parameter. But when one solves the Dyson-Schwinger equations for different gauges, one finds that this is not the case. This suggests that the non-zero solution bifurcates away from the trivial solution beyond the critical value of the coupling, indicating a physical phase change.\"\n",
