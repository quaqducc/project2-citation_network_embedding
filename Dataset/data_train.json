        "answer": "The Chiral Quark Soliton Model (CQSM) is a field theoretical model based on a non-renormalizable lagrangian. It describes the mesonic properties in terms of quark fields and dynamically generates the soliton, which is the intrinsic object representing a baryon."

        "question": "How does the CQSM describe baryons?",
        "answer": "In the CQSM, baryons are described as a version of an eﬀective model derived from the instanton liquid model with constant constituent quark mass. It allows for an uniﬁed description of mesons and baryons, both in ﬂavours SU(2) and SU(3), with a small number of free parameters."

        "question": "How is the soliton in the CQSM obtained?",
        "answer": "The soliton in the CQSM is obtained through the nucleon correlation function. An saddle-point approximation for the correlation function, represented as a path integral, agrees with the Hartree picture of the nucleon as a bound state of Nc weakly interacting quarks in the meson field Uc."

        "answer": "The model assumes that isospin breaking is a small effect and neglects it in its calculations. However, it is noted in the paper that this assumption may not be valid in calculations based on the 1 /Ncexpansion, as a truncation is always involved and, in the end, Nc is taken to be Nc= 3."

This means that the top quark will decay with a deﬁnite polarization, which can be measured through the distribution of its decay products. The theoretical predictions become more reliable free of the complications of hadronization."

        "answer": "The polarization of the top quark introduces a new dependence on cos θb, not only though cos θtb, and changes the behavior on cos θtb, or equivalently on Eb. This allows to form different asymmetries, whose nonzero value would imply a nonzero polarization of the top quark."

        "question": "How is the energy spectrum of the b-quarks affected by the polarization of the decaying t-quarks?",
        "answer": "If the t-quarks decay depolarized, the cross section for a given energy Eb would not depend on the energy of the b-quark. The polarization of the decaying t-quarks turns this constant behavior into a linear Eb-behavior, the decline determined by G3."

These processes, in turn, constrain physics beyond the SM, including supersymmetric models. Any deviation of CP violation from the SM predictions can be a strong hint to physics beyond the SM."

In the first model, they assign different modular weights for the first and second families, leading to an almost degenerate squark mass spectrum. In the second model, they assume an extra U(1) gauge symmetry and explore a direction around a special point in parameter space where the soft scalar masses are degenerate."

However, in this analysis, the authors assume that the phase of φµ is usually constrained by the experimental limit of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, so they can assume it to be zero for their analysis."

[14] that non-degenerate A-parameters can generate the experimentally observed CP violation εeven with the vanishing CKM CP phase δCKM= 0, that is, the fully supersymmetric CP violation in the Kaon system is possible."

Thermal equilibration requires less correlated momenta of emitted particles and the decrease of the momentum correlation parameter Φ by one order of magnitude when going from p+p to Pb+Pb indicates a significant reduction in correlation, but it does not necessarily mean thermalization at late times in the collision."

First, by deﬁning the parameters ( λ,A,̺,η) through a change of variables in the standard parametrization, we can obtain the CKM matrix as a function of these parameters, which satisfies unitarity exactly. Second, by including the constraints from CP-violating quantities such as εK and ∆Md, in the standard analysis, we can further improve the accuracy of the matrix elements."

For instance, when these inputs are varied within their ranges, the uncertainties coming from |Vcb| and |Vub| cannot be represented simultaneously in the (¯ ̺,¯η) plane in terms of nice hyperbolas and circles. This is due to the correlation between εK and ∆Mddue to variations in mt and |Vcb|."

However, if Majorana neutrinos are included, the standard theory cannot simply include them by gauge invariance alone. This is because the gauge charges of Dirac and Majorana fermions are typically different."

In particular, in cases where CP is violated, the decay lepton angular distribution does not factorize in production and decay and depends sensitively on spin correlations. This shows the possibility to establish the Majorana character by comparing the measured decay energy and opening angle distributions with MC–studies including the complete spin relations."

        "answer": "The quark condensate in QCD1+1, an analytic expression for which is derived in the limit of an inﬁnite number of colors, is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, it indicates spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry. Secondly, the condensate is nonanalytic in the coupling constant, indicating nonperturbative effects.

        "answer": "When neutrinos propagate in a medium, the inﬂuence of matter on neutrino oscillations can be very important. For example, for νe→νµ oscillations, this is due to the fact that the mass eigenstates, which propagate as free plane waves in vacuum, do not coincide with ﬂavour eigenstates, leading to a “resonance” in neutrino oscillations."

        "question": "What is the effect of the mass interaction with the matter on chirality-preserving transitions?",
        "answer": "When the mass interaction with matter is predominant, the physical propagating neutrino field is no longer composed primarily of vacuum Majorana state, which leads to a dramatic reduction in the probability of νL→νc\nLtransitions. This results in a peculiar situation where the study of neutrino oscillation phenomena can potentially rely on the fact that certain probabilities have an oscillatory behavior over time while others remain time-independent."

        "question": "How are the transition probabilities related to the effective potential in neutrino propagation?",
        "answer": "The transition probabilities are sensitive to the effective potential experienced by neutrinos in a medium. This effective potential can be much smaller than the neutrino momentum in normal situations, except for relic neutrinos propagating in very dense stars. As such, the corrections to the transition probabilities due to matter interaction are usually quite insignificant."

The number of non-interacting nucleons decreases to the value about 3% at√sNN= 5.5 TeV.

It helps in reducing the LL prediction by choosing a large scale dictated by BLM and subsequently reducing the NLL corrections.

This could potentially lead to a negative BFKL Pomeron intercept, implying that the cross section would decrease, rather than increase, as a power of the energy. However, the interpretation is not entirely well-defined due to the running coupling term in the NLL BFKL solution."

While the CSM cannot be considered a sufficiently reliable model to describe heavy quarkonium production and decay, the NRQCD FA implies that heavy quarkonium can be produced through color octet quark-antiquark states, and the evolution of the (Q¯Q)-pair to the final hadronic state is parameterized by nonperturbative matrix elements."

        "answer": "The presence of lepton number violations in the MSSM without R-parity allows for interesting mixing and dynamics among the various particles in the model. However, it also requires careful consideration of the effects of baryon-number violations, as proton decay experiments have set stringent restrictions on the violations of the first and second generations of the baryon-numbers."

This leads to a more general and flexible structure for the chargino and neutralino masses."

For instance, the model's predictions for the lightest Higgs mass are not as strongly constrained as in the R-parity conserving MSSM, which limits its theoretical basis. However, the model does make novel predictions and allows for interesting exploration of lepton number violations and their effects on the physics of the standard model."

Furthermore, the BBL approximation seems realistic for DIS on heavy nuclear targets, as it assumes that hadronic configurations with impact parameters satisfying b2≤b2max are completely absorbed by the target."

        "question": "Why is CPviolation important in baryogenesis?",
        "answer": "CPviolation is crucial for baryogenesis because it allows for the creation of a particle number asymmetry. This asymmetry arises when, during the electroweak phase transition, a CPviolating space-time dependent phase appears in the mass matrix of the particles. This phase cannot be rotated away at subsequent points, leading to different propagation probabilities for particles and anti-particles, and thus resulting in a particle number asymmetry."

In the impulse approximation, this momentum transfer has to be provided by the active nucleon, and after that, the final state of this active nucleon still has to fit into the final deuteron. However, the deuteron is a loosely bound system, which means that an asymmetrical sharing of longitudinal momentum between the nucleons may be suppressed."

They are constrained by the bulk equations, and their values can affect the behavior of the bulk geometry. For example, when the time derivatives are not excessively large, the bulk field equations only constrain the radial dependence of the tensions."

It works by replacing the variable Nf with β0= (11Nc−2Nf)/12, where Nc is the number of colours and Nf is the number of active flavours. This method is simple but powerful, and it is used to analyze the theoretical uncertainties in the 4-loop extract ions of the running and the invariants-quark masses from QCD sum rules."

Higher order corrections in the 4-fermion theory at the upper scale µ can move the top mass upward by about 10 GeV, near 175 GeV. Similarly, the Higgs mass moves downward by a similar amount, to near 125 GeV."

        "answer": "Fine tuning is crucial in this 4-fermion theory as it determines the dimensionful scalar coupling in terms of the cutoff Λ. After fine-tuning and wave function renormalisation, the dimensionless couplings of the Standard Model are replaced by the dimensionless couplings of the 4-fermion theory, and the gradient expansion of the effective action is an expansion in these dimensionless electroweak couplings."

        "answer": "The addition of boundary conditions at a high mass scale sharply does not significantly impact the predictions. Since the top quark evolution is strongly influenced by SU(3)c from µ∼1014 downward, and the running of αW is also significant, varying the mass scale µ over four orders of magnitude from µ= 1010GeV to µ= 1014GeV has practically no effect on the top mass."

This is demonstrated through numerical integration of the renormalisation equations, varying the inputs, and observing the resulting impact on the predicted masses."

        "question": "How does the truncation error develop when the cut is approached in the Minkowski domain?",
        "answer": "The truncation error tends to zero as 1 /Q2 nor faster in the euclidean domain. However, when the cut is approached, the integral in the Minkowski domain becomes larger and dies off slower than in the euclidean domain, which could potentially lead to a larger overall error."

        "question": "How does the model manage to implement right-handed currents while staying compatible with the standard electroweak model?",
        "answer": "The model achieves compatibility with the standard electroweak model by allowing the third generation to have right-handed currents which are not dominant in the weak decay of the b-quark. This way, the model can adhere to the standard model's chiral structure while still allowing for right-handed currents."

For instance, they can induce a difference of the value of |Vcb| extracted from the total inclusive semileptonic decay rate of the Bmesons and the amplitude of the exclusive decay B→D∗l−νl. This difference is sensitive to an admixture of a right-handed b→ccurrent, which can be interpreted in terms of the ξparameter."

For instance, for tan β=3, the total BR of the 4-body decay approaches 100% for m˜t1≥100, and approaches 100% for slightly higher values of m˜t1. This suggests that the searches for stop NLSP in this mass range should be based on the 4-body decay channel."

However, in the context of massive particles, the definition of the fragmentation variable is ambiguous. It cannot be the energy of the stop \"meson\" after fragmentation, as this would violate energy conservation. Nor can it be the absolute value of the 3–momentum, as this would also violate momentum conservation."

        "answer": "The emission of a hard gluon allows for the discovery or exclusion of stop squarks even when there is very small mass splitting between the stop and the LSP. It also helps to increase the total visible energy and the total missing transverse momentum, which can help to discriminate between stop pair events and backgrounds from two–photon reactions."

One of the main uncertainties is the lack of understanding of non–perturbative stop fragmentation. Also, the fragmentation processes, being a complex and poorly understood phenomenon, could introduce significant uncertainties in the total cross section of stop pair production."

On the other hand, the multinomial process is deﬁned by placing a ﬁxed number of particles independently of each other into the domain according to a probability density. Despite the particles being placed independently, the standard factorial cumulants of the multinomial process are nonzero, indicating purely \"external\" correlations."

The kinematics of the partonic reaction is generated according to equations that include the helicity dependent DGLAP splitting functions. This allows for the direct calculation of cross sections for different helicity conﬁgurations of the colliding hadrons."

It is calculated as a function of the relative phase between the spin of the colliding hadrons and the spin of the produced particles. Different methods, such as the method of asymmetry weights (MAW) and next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD calculations, can be used to estimate this value."

Asimple way to overcome this deficit was presented by the authors of the EG Sphinx, which is a polarizedversion ofPythia. However, MAW and Sphinx may yield significantly different results for the hadronic double spin asymmetries."

        "answer": "Non-oscillatory models (NO models) are a class of inflationary models in which the effective potential of the inﬂaton field does not have a minimum. Instead, the inﬂaton field does not oscillate after inﬂation, which leads to a unique set of cosmological problems."
      },

        "question": "What are the main problems associated with non-oscillatory models?",
        "answer": "The main problems of NO models arise from their non-oscillatory behavior, which causes the standard mechanism of reheating based on the decay of the oscillating inﬂaton field to fail. Instead, gravitational particle production in an expanding universe may lead to cosmological problems, including large isocurvature ﬂuctuations and overproduction of dangerous relics such as gravitinos and moduli ﬁelds."

        "question": "What is the scenario of instant preheating?",
        "answer": "The scenario of instant preheating involves the inﬂaton field rapidly rolling down its efﬃcient potential towards φ= 0, which drives a non-adiabatic change in the mass of the scalar field χ. This process allows for a very efﬁcient energy transfer from the inﬂaton field to particles χ."

      {
        "question": "How does the effective mass of the inﬂaton field affect the reheating process in NO models?",
        "answer": "The effective mass of the inﬂaton field φ at phi < 0 is given by √3λφ. At the end of inﬂation, when φ ∼ Mp, this mass is of the same order as the Hubble constant ∼ λφ2/Mp. This means that within the Hubble time H−1, the field φ rolls to the valley at φ > 0 and its mass vanishes."

        "question": "What is the effect of non-local wave-function renormalization in the presence of the Higgs VEV?",
        "answer": "In the presence of the Higgs VEV on the TeV boundary, the \"zero modes\" of the W and Z gauge bosons are no longer flat in the extra dimension. This leads to localized mass terms that repel the wave function in the vicinity of the TeV boundary, resulting in non-oblique contributions to electroweak observables."

It is generally believed that this parameter, which controls the hierarchy of fermion masses, should be of order one. However, in models with νf not universally, the shifts in fermion couplings to the W and Z gauge bosons can be non-universal, leading to FCNC."

For instance, in the scenario with only gauge fields propagating in the bulk, the 95% C.L. bound on Λ r is Λ r>11 TeV, tightening up on the previous bound of m1>27 TeV."

For instance, an operator suppressed by the TeV scale could contribute to the Zcouplings to the fermion f, potentially adding a significant shift to the Zcouplings. However, for the purpose of this analysis, it is assumed that these operators will not change considerably the constraints derived in the section."

        "answer": "The ZFITTER Fortran package is primarily used for the description of fermion-pair production in e+e−-annihilation. It aids in treating the radiative corrections to the total cross-section and the integrated forward-backward asymmetry with combined cuts on acollinearity angle, acceptance angle, and minimal energy of the fermions."

      {
        "question": "What does the acollinearity cut in ZFITTER mean?",
        "answer": "In the context of ZFITTER, an acollinearity cut refers to a specific cutting strategy in the phase-space parameterisation. It helps to define a region in the phase space where the particles being analyzed (fermions, in this case) do not collinearly emit soft photons. This cut is crucial in avoiding double counting of certain contributions."

        "question": "How does the acceptance cut influence the ZFITTER predictions?",
        "answer": "An acceptance cut, when applied, restricts the phase space that is integrated over in ZFITTER. Depending on the cut's position and strength, it can influence the numerical output of ZFITTER significantly. For example, in the context of initial-state radiation, the acceptance cut can affect the phase-space splitting and the integrated results."

        "question": "What are the changes that were observed in ZFITTER's predictions when an acollinearity cut was applied in the past?",
        "answer": "Previously, it was found that applying an acollinearity cut led to significant deviations in ZFITTER's predictions. These deviations were observed to be most prominent at LEP 1 energies and were generally considered to be due to the fact that the hard photonic corrections were not suppressed by the cut."

        "question": "How does the radiative return affect the photonic corrections in ZFITTER?",
        "answer": "The radiative return, or the production of real photons in association with the initial-state radiation, can affect the photonic corrections in ZFITTER. This happens when the radiative return is prevented by the acollinearity cut or acceptance cut, as it was the case in the past. However, the influence of hard photonic corrections is much smaller at higher energies where the radiative return is no longer completely suppressed."

It also addresses the issue of negative signs in the term D2 in variable SFIN of subroutine FUNFIN."

Depending on the flag settings, ZCUT calculates the cross-sections and asymmetries corresponding to various cutting strategies."

Along the way, it accounts for various processes such as bremsstrahlung, direct e+e−-pair production, photo-nuclear interaction, and knock-on electro n production. The propagation is accomplished by solving a set of numerical equations, interpolating, and integrating, with the resulting energy loss being accounted for in the simulation."

Different possibilities for the LSP, such as a neutralino with a large higgsino content, a stable charged slepton, or a sneutrino, lead to very different decay patterns and production rates, making it possible to distinguish between different supersymmetric scenarios."

        "answer": "Yes, the author mentions that they may consider going back to the chiral quark model because the success of the constituent quark model is not yet understood. The author also suggests that perhaps the constituent quark model operates and wavefunctions simply have the right symmetry properties, and corrections to their matrix elements are suppressed for some reason."

        "question": "What is the role of the gauge field in the soliton model?",
        "answer": "The gauge field surrounding the soliton may screen the particle’s charge, which could allow for perturbative interactions between qualitons even when αs is large. However, this is just a potential solution, and more research is needed to see if this screening is enough to make the qualiton model realistic."

        "answer": "In the constituent quark model, the ratio of the color magnetic moment to the magnetic moment is proportional to µc/β= 1.12. This information is used in Section 4 for numerical computations. Any deviation from this ratio in the model could signify an issue with the model's compatibility with the experimental data."

        "question": "What are the constraints on the mass of the lightest Higgs in supersymmetric models?",
        "answer": "In minimal scenarios, the requirement that the adimensional coupling λ remains perturbative up to the unification scale constrains λ to be smaller than ≈0.7. This mass constraint could be increased to 155 GeV in models containing nonstandard fields at intermediate scales, suggesting the presence of extra matter fields."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the presence of extra matter fields affect the maximum value of λ in supersymmetric models?",
        "answer": "The presence of extra matter fields can raise the maximum value of λ up to a 19%, which in turn increases the limits on the mass of the lightest Higgs from 135 GeV to 155 GeV."

        "question": "What is the main motivation for supersymmetric extensions of the standard model?",
        "answer": "The main motivation of supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the standard model is their stability against quantum corrections. SUSY models provide a framework to integrate large energy scales together with the observed low-energy physics, which is a generic motivation highlighted by the recent perturbative unification of the three gauge couplings in the minimal extension (MSSM)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the most compelling prediction of SUSY models?",
        "answer": "The most compelling prediction of SUSY models is probably the presence of a light Higgs field. In particular, the MSSM forces the CP-even scalar field h0 to have a tree-level mass smaller than MZ, which is enhanced by the presence of extra matter fields."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the addition of matter fields at intermediate scales affect the evolution of the gauge couplings in SUSY models?",
        "answer": "The addition of matter fields at intermediate scales can increase the evolution rate of the gauge couplings, which in turn decreases the evolution rate of the adimensional coupling λ. This means that larger initial values of this coupling would remain perturbative up to the grand unification scale, allowing for a higher maximum value of λat the weak scale."

        "question": "What is the relevance of gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) in SUSY models?",
        "answer": "GMSB is a scenario in which the breaking of supersymmetry is accomplished through the exchange of gauge bosons. It is motivated by the presence of extra matter fields at intermediate scales, and it could potentially explain the observed hierarchy of energy scales."

      {
        "question": "How does the singlet model contribute to the physics of SUSY models when it is extended with a gauge singlet?",
        "answer": "In the singlet model, the presence of a gauge singlet allows for a different framework to integrate large energy scales. This model can still accommodate a light neutral Higgs, but the bounds on its mass are significantly relaxed, extending the range from 128 GeV to 155 GeV."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the impact of vectorlike fields on the bounds of the lightest Higgs boson in SUSY models?",
        "answer": "The presence of vectorlike fields at intermediate scales can significantly relax the bounds on the mass of the lightest Higgs boson. In scenarios motivated by GMSB, the gauge unification of the minimal model is preserved, and the range of tan β consistent with a perturbative value of all the parameters up to the unification scale is extended."

      {
        "question": "How does the presence of extra couplings of the Higgs with the intermediate matter (messenger fields) affect the running of λ in GMSB scenarios?",
        "answer": "The presence of extra couplings of the Higgs with the intermediate matter sectors induces scalar trilinears at the one-loop level. For example, the coupling W⊃λ′HΦ¯Φ can contribute to the trilinear and scalar mass, adding a new contribution to βλ."

        "question": "Are there viable GMSB scenarios with a singlet?",
        "answer": "Yes, there are regions of the parameter space of the model that lead to phenomenologically viable scenarios of electr oweak symmetry breaking. For instance, the model proposed in reference [11], with the sliding singlet [14], has a (at least local) minimum in which µ is of the order of the weak scale. However, a certain degree of fine tuning of the parameters is required to obtain an acceptable minimum."

It consists of adding a second Higgs doublet with the same quantum numbers as the first one. This model aims to explain the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of mass for weak vector bosons and fermions."

        "answer": "The Standard Model has been extremely successful in describing most of the known small-scale phenomenology, but it possesses problems that could be solved by going beyond its scope. The motivation to develop the 2HDM was to wonder whether the Higgs sector is not minimal and to explore the simplest extension compatible with gauge invariance."

      {
        "question": "Can you explain the Higgs mechanism as it occurs in the 2HDM?",
        "answer": "Certainly! The Higgs mechanism in the 2HDM works by acquiring a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) for the Higgs doublet field. This mechanism generates a massive scalar field (the Higgs particle) and a massive four-vector field (the photon)."

        "question": "How does the local gauge invariance principle influence the 2HDM?",
        "answer": "The local gauge invariance principle, inspired by classical electrodynamics, generates the gauge bosons and their interactions among matter and themselves. In the context of the 2HDM, this principle allows for the implementation of the SSB phenomenon, which in turn generates the masses of weak vector bosons and fermions."

        "question": "What is the significance of the Goldstone theorem in the context of the 2HDM?",
        "answer": "The Goldstone theorem states that the number of would-be Goldstone bosons generated after a symmetry breaking is equal to the number of broken generators. In the 2HDM, this means that instead of working with four broken generators, we work with three broken generators and one unbroken generator, ensuring the photon remains massless while the other three gauge bosons acquire masses."

        "question": "How does the Yukawa Lagrangian factor into the 2HDM?",

        "answer": "The non-abelianity of the gauge group, in this case, the SU(2)L×U(1)Y, generates self interactions among the associated gauge bosons. It's important in ensuring that the photon remains massless while the other three gauge bosons acquire masses."

For parametrization type II, taking mh0=120 GeV and that the other MSSM Higgs bosons are very heavy, the lower bound for /tildewideξµτvsmH0is /tildewideξµτ=2.5×10−3 and the upper bound is /tildewideξµτ=2.5×10−2."
