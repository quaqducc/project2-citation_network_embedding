9409083,1994,"String theories should reduce to ordinary four-dimensional field theories at
low energies. Yet the formulation of the two are so different that such a
connection, if it exists, is not immediately obvious. With the Schwinger
proper-time representation, and the spinor helicity technique, it has been
shown that field theories can indeed be written in a string-like manner, thus
resulting in simplifications in practical calculations, and providing novel
insights into gauge and gravitational theories. This paper continues the study
of string organization of field theories by focusing on the question of local
duality. It is shown that a single expression for the sum of many diagrams can
indeed be written for QED, thereby simulating the duality property in strings.
The relation between a single diagram and the dual sum is somewhat analogous to
the relation between a old- fashioned perturbation diagram and a Feynman
diagram. Dual expressions are particularly significant for gauge theories
because they are gauge invariant while expressions for single diagrams are not.",-0.24023353,0.2015136,0.20773502,0.3664811,-0.13086672,0.51374066,0.14116675,-0.3835559,0.17165528,0.014552139,-0.24151185,0.25113034,-0.11976673,-0.44632038,0.25298727,0.1060406,-0.077865906,0.11292398,0.11604234,0.035980523,0.35053533,-0.44873133,-0.10158079,-0.80305964,-0.48175097,0.54309666,-0.29257765,0.20239869,-0.22488584,0.10317892,0.110311806,0.4180418,-0.09116413,0.20743614,0.20473401,-0.37997448,-0.12752979,0.0052033365,0.31105456,0.08424847,-0.03765457,-0.11538724,-0.4178183,0.2658288,0.1537615,-0.24540867,-0.020440772,0.06515139,0.23269303,0.072285876,0.17458475,-0.13950971,-0.29659095,0.09985,-0.03209038,0.35599315,-0.06891239,-0.2068451,-0.46325395,0.5623339,-0.12701896,-0.20041873,0.26893374,0.06443572,0.41772592,-0.001067251,0.20028877,-0.038417175,-0.14577933,0.12664726,0.44174302,-0.20703757,0.027427107,0.587679,0.18079405,-0.045722358,-0.38772526,-0.10165574,-0.112534374,-0.22000518,0.368567,0.31368318,0.07004799,-0.035518974,-0.22354606,-0.091240846,-0.0447203,0.0028853416,-0.2210222,0.008164801,-0.4919603,0.24615414,0.1855564,0.41735137,-0.17131168,0.4805174,-0.101951316,0.55021626,0.02596008,0.1450444,0.008463234,0.093479335,0.19733858,-0.2822856,0.29509446,0.002443798,0.39645457,0.38495672,0.2413295,0.3151381,0.108253404,-0.26422435,-0.19988117,0.27461624,-0.23567846,0.34364802,0.42832392,-0.03036964,0.07995983,0.21311694,-0.10128948,0.13718405,0.035318643,0.23575352,-0.008808803,-0.39106727,-0.19381404,0.27351394

N=8 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions gives rise to
type IIA long string configurations. We point out that the quantum moduli space

the M(atrix) theory. The two quantum numbers become familiar if one switches to
a IIB picture, where they represent configurations of D-strings and

9712104,1997,"Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) seems to be a very promising
technique for evaluating massless and/or massive Feynman diagrams. It is unique
in the sense that the method simultaneously gives solutions in different
regions of external momenta. Moreover, it is a technique whereby the
difficulties associated with performing parametric integrals --- the standard
approach --- are transferred to a simpler solving of a system of linear
algebraic equations. Employing this method, we calculate a massless two-loop
three point vertex with all the external legs off-shell. Then NDIM approach
allows us to obtain twenty-one distinct new power series representations for
the integral in question. In order to verify the correctness of our results, we
consider five particular cases where either two of the external legs are put
on-shell, or one of them amputated or one exponent of the propagators is set to
zero, and compare our results thus obtained with the ones calculated with
standard methods in positive dimension.",-0.19135952,-0.17195164,0.30328748,-0.5531678,0.2502368,0.07163024,-0.21969068,-0.19021101,0.5614246,0.27998716,-0.076428086,-0.20563757,-0.037349224,-0.15725787,0.15494175,-0.5103738,-0.19861448,0.44045743,0.061669298,-0.14867042,0.010818452,0.028507456,-0.55878127,0.3079796,0.104713306,0.25845775,0.2608226,-0.013444617,-0.011080392,-0.019693494,-0.16593766,-0.19345333,-0.11072157,0.3085281,0.14990087,0.1348304,-0.07648312,-0.18891719,-0.05335894,-0.044781834,-0.13910769,-0.15855171,0.09384026,-0.3177067,-0.29009894,-0.29510564,-0.09725276,-0.08020604,-0.2421649,0.046927854,0.044222146,0.3547616,-0.18245809,-0.0016627461,-0.2948509,-0.1339931,-0.065539956,0.054110497,0.09052679,0.2717716,0.19274053,-0.08989318,-0.33469027,0.31571826,0.09589137,-0.054398734,0.081516445,-0.037072062,-0.07758949,0.07364826,-0.23693109,0.07503393,0.12761876,0.38488606,0.37823653,-0.33961487,0.2566849,-0.21286747,0.10785533,0.18166682,-0.4178622,0.24655776,-0.41938308,-0.27282262,-0.38442767,0.19172016,-0.09588822,0.02057235,-0.06055483,0.1809834,-0.13783908,-0.21674356,-0.006973505,0.15492357,0.035322838,-0.27826092,-0.21535948,0.009544432,-0.0118723735,0.063245215,-0.40241233,-0.13297334,-0.088870436,0.14344174,-0.0075903386,0.19197494,-0.35465604,-0.0321202,-0.004490003,0.5399691,0.12338837,0.010936856,-0.03493905,-0.14858711,0.12970963,-0.020418562,0.09882108,-0.068116784,0.0782316,-0.053880442,-0.18731934,0.0037962496,-0.02455452,-0.21713853,-0.35449412,-0.40461427,0.04266978,0.06819191

9606025,1996,"The Virasoro master equation (VME) describes the general affine-Virasoro
construction $T=L^{ab}J_aJ_b+iD^a \dif J_a$ in the operator algebra of the WZW
model, where $L^{ab}$ is the inverse inertia tensor and $D^a $ is the
improvement vector. In this paper, we generalize this construction to find the
general (one-loop) Virasoro construction in the operator algebra of the general
non-linear sigma model. The result is a unified Einstein-Virasoro master
equation which couples the spacetime spin-two field $L^{ab}$ to the background
fields of the sigma model. For a particular solution $L_G^{ab}$, the unified
system reduces to the canonical stress tensors and conventional Einstein
equations of the sigma model, and the system reduces to the general
affine-Virasoro construction and the VME when the sigma model is taken to be
the WZW action. More generally, the unified system describes a space of
conformal field theories which is presumably much larger than the sum of the
general affine-Virasoro construction and the sigma model with its canonical
stress tensors. We also discuss a number of algebraic and geometrical
properties of the system, including its relation to an unsolved problem in the

9304152,1993,"The gauge equivalence between basic KP hierarchies is discussed. The first
two Hamiltonian structures for KP hierarchies leading to the linear and
non-linear $\Winf$ algebras are derived. The realization of the corresponding
generators in terms of two boson currents is presented and it is shown to be
related to many integrable models which are bi-Hamiltonian. We can also realize
those generators by adding extra currents, coupled in a particular way,
allowing for instance a description of multi-layered Benney equations or
multi-component non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this case we can have a
second Hamiltonian bracket structure which violates Jacobi identity. We
consider the reduction to one-boson systems leading to KdV and mKdV
hierarchies. A Miura transformation relating these two hierarchies is obtained
by restricting gauge transformation between corresponding two-boson
hierarchies. Connection to Drinfeld-Sokolov approach is also discussed in the
$SL(2,\IR)$ gauge theory. (Lectures presented at the VII J.A. Swieca Summer

9811022,1998,"We consider firstly simple D=4 superalgebra with six real tensorial central
charges $Z_{\mu\nu}$, and discuss its possible realizations in massive and
massless cases. Massless case is dynamically realized by generalized
Ferber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonic spinor coordinates. The
Lorentz invariance is not broken due to the realization of central charges
generators in terms of bosonic spinors. The model contains four fermionic
coordinates and possesses three kappa-symmetries thus providing the BPS
configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show that
the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann variable)
of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. The relation with
recent superparticle model by Rudychev and Sezgin is pointed out. Finally we
propose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one real
fundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle with
composite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane model
with nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically.",-0.080163695,-0.07983509,-0.03475094,-0.30070212,0.10891219,0.15043786,-0.029106926,0.16394228,-0.13954543,0.094772816,0.063670725,-0.019445345,-0.44606414,-0.27256417,-0.1331277,-0.115497544,-0.12483789,0.11447373,-0.037048478,0.11062695,-0.1436039,0.1710949,-0.11190965,-0.16392732,0.093218215,0.0535756,0.31087887,-0.11152607,0.14334564,-0.06826015,-0.08547562,-0.0776939,0.018092737,0.1906659,-0.13183868,-0.16068469,0.019230574,-0.2886198,0.31996018,0.21310708,-0.07992526,-0.30611768,0.18471576,-0.44561166,0.056988552,-0.1752378,-0.09458053,0.14024077,0.057301756,0.1906425,-0.2710354,-0.26501736,-0.0002796948,0.11747545,0.0030468707,-0.22435454,-0.011211567,0.16804233,0.2541229,0.24086311,-0.023531452,0.08197019,0.1390997,0.060879797,0.33788937,0.20830268,-0.5135753,0.10808437,-0.21069312,-0.28189522,-0.10519364,0.029613078,0.16764466,-0.15780401,0.13844554,0.048066452,0.25933006,0.013687015,-0.2166492,0.04763792,0.27417278,-0.1657651,-0.18494123,0.2717707,0.15772131,-0.028142616,-0.06627073,0.062089175,-0.16205972,0.018916644,-0.11449462,0.036508307,0.18894726,0.08536213,0.12555458,0.07733794,-0.07745376,0.28875902,-0.17884266,0.028807078,0.15974095,0.17367166,0.40825075,0.04860337,0.26718676,0.032724798,0.05585619,0.25661507,-0.18452857,-0.13357787,-0.14180672,0.22840136,0.21832512,-0.23672393,0.034576878,-0.49706513,0.110446714,0.28519705,0.069650024,-0.15299927,-0.02506134,0.014775395,0.10594952,0.15000106,0.19746326,-0.03705433,0.25519896,0.062748715

only as cross sections of complicated (n+1)+1 backgrounds. Further we give near
horizon solutions (e.g. n+1 Robertson-Bertotti). Since two time physics can

4-dimensional $\CN=4$ SU(n) super-Yang-Mills theories with respect to discrete
subgroups of the SU(4) $R$-symmetry which act nontrivially on the gauge group.
We show that for every discrete subgroup of SU(4) there is a canonical choice
of imbedding of the discrete group in the gauge group which leads to theories
with a vanishing one-loop beta-function. We conjecture that these give rise to
(generically non-supersymmetric) conformal theories. The gauge group is
$\otimes_i SU(Nn_i)$ where $n_i$ denote the dimension of the irreducible
representations of the corresponding discrete group; there is also
bifundamental matter, dictated by associated quiver diagrams. The interactions
can also be read off from the quiver diagram. For SU(3) and SU(2) subgroups
this leads to superconformal theories with $\CN=1$ and $\CN=2$ respectively. In
the $\CN=1$ case we prove the vanishing of the beta functions to two loops.",-0.24213994,-0.09709525,0.07931073,-0.17209826,-0.10916567,0.15725954,-0.06390503,-0.113146245,-0.04278055,0.08728433,0.102667406,0.09511926,-0.029824648,-0.38213974,0.043345895,-0.030077532,0.0019952413,-0.11296895,-0.049657904,0.047735948,-0.10025739,0.13040937,0.04155689,0.061397895,0.14453764,0.07854814,0.076195925,-0.014967643,0.06678479,-0.16253628,0.030909806,0.09520815,-0.19108167,0.006743014,-0.17752324,0.0457818,-0.11983,0.028360546,-0.00840012,0.016790956,-0.20023154,-0.1735569,-0.19637798,0.15304716,-0.14126645,-0.06993494,0.34815606,0.03726125,-0.03504634,-0.079995304,-0.076366365,-0.063191496,0.012893744,-0.15355825,0.038670167,-0.042647615,0.17471878,-0.29285008,0.17126182,0.30085912,0.08751402,0.09026182,-0.005894799,-0.07225457,0.06254055,0.18894741,0.10191842,-0.04212673,0.13784124,-0.014580369,0.14842615,0.26030707,-0.16744849,0.1498524,-0.04653102,0.034775905,0.2243759,0.19386217,-0.17192292,-0.06292643,-0.055899136,0.074919984,0.11340639,-0.102222696,0.12910107,-0.17506084,0.051355127,0.1696201,0.08193005,-0.10299962,-0.00944742,-0.055661112,0.010595761,-0.014950629,0.015148468,-0.13730295,-0.11918561,-0.13357195,-0.032629333,-0.083742455,-0.10358209,0.06287995,0.16297984,-0.13699868,0.15685141,-0.018384106,0.016238034,0.05733971,0.009589568,-0.37245,0.17267656,-0.16660894,0.23334023,-0.122614756,-0.009901971,-0.14036202,-0.15078649,0.20728056,-0.17139998,-0.079820134,-0.08403609,0.13835746,-0.022443883,-0.16232254,-0.1817376,-0.018492587,0.08559247,-0.09971511
9206006,1992,"Using a Hamiltonian approach to gauged WZW models, we present a general
method for computing the conformally exact metric and dilaton, to all orders in
the $1/k$ expansion, for any bosonic, heterotic, or type-II superstring model
based on a coset $G/H$. We prove the following relations: (i) For type-II
superstrings the conformally exact metric and dilaton are identical to those of
the non-supersymmetric {\it semi-classical} bosonic model except for an overall
renormalization of the metric obtained by $k\to k- g$. (ii) The exact
expressions for the heterotic superstring are derived from their exact bosonic
string counterparts by shifting the central extension $k\to 2k-h$ (but an
overall factor $(k-g)$ remains unshifted). (iii) The combination
$e^\Phi\sqrt{-G}$ is independent of $k$ and therefore can be computed in lowest
order perturbation theory as required by the correct formulation of a
conformally invariant path integral measure. The general formalism is applied
to the coset models $SO(d-1,2)_{-k}/SO(d-1,1)_{-k}$ that are relevant for
string theory on curved spacetime. Explicit expressions for the conformally
exact metric and dilaton for the cases $d=2,3,4$ are given. In the
semiclassical limit $(k\to \infty)$ our results agree with those obtained with
the Lagrangian method up to 1-loop in perturbation theory.",-0.11347416,0.09043306,-0.16849427,-0.07227641,-0.08279311,0.09196535,0.053082645,0.0691361,-0.079785824,-0.106306404,-0.08978513,-0.13588965,0.020533582,-0.22922198,-0.073905446,-0.1200808,-0.09431973,-0.32173842,-0.17418213,0.12265187,-0.18886346,0.03968139,-0.04039383,0.032049887,0.14086522,0.12641191,-0.0022691041,0.08751542,0.08063562,-0.15638211,-0.005610816,-0.103455804,-0.11818734,0.09152824,0.23591855,0.028590593,-0.11770996,0.035727635,0.023115335,0.017968178,-0.13147627,0.047867887,0.122881666,-0.12627915,0.09323914,0.15635942,0.24459457,-0.162198,0.08928736,-0.10732205,-0.0029671565,0.11870974,-0.0110812485,0.027605653,0.0012709349,-0.13981986,-0.20415644,0.19284737,0.37528735,0.002968572,-0.031435877,0.044203334,-0.21992067,-0.11030671,0.09333827,-0.032146804,0.14320385,0.12677152,-0.14142743,-0.14515315,0.0168107,0.16772588,0.06381161,-0.057808325,-0.047203552,-0.11558196,0.08444233,0.14521112,0.15337025,-0.00762056,-0.05547645,0.097764924,0.039494973,0.0768937,-0.009056613,0.033799246,0.11356568,0.080767125,0.039972477,-0.17823845,0.032948107,0.1244289,-0.093272395,0.02632748,-0.100558065,-0.17593113,0.22751218,-0.148787,-0.034644723,-0.06217101,-0.17241383,0.010643467,-0.029681899,0.049793303,0.0051650926,-0.09013834,-0.15929541,0.034430243,0.20029654,-0.08358592,0.03251131,-0.1402858,0.2537106,-0.29337674,0.03220685,0.101964526,0.048100863,0.024999827,0.1620242,-0.0041332846,-0.027304359,0.14597104,-0.14556317,-0.0010532402,0.029955328,-0.09841165,-0.026282467,-0.12104008

9712066,1997,"We analyze and give explicit representations for the effective abelian vector
gauge field actions generated by charged fermions with particular attention to
the thermal regime in odd dimensions, where spectral asymmetry can be present.
We show, through $\zeta-$function regularization, that both small and large
gauge invariances are preserved at any temperature and for any number of
fermions at the usual price of anomalies: helicity/parity invariance will be
lost in even/odd dimensions, and in the latter even at zero mass. Gauge
invariance dictates a very general ``Fourier'' representation of the action in
terms of the holonomies that carry the novel, large gauge invariant,
information. We show that large (unlike small) transformations and hence their
Ward identities, are not perturbative order-preserving, and clarify the role of
(properly redefined) Chern-Simons terms in this context. From a powerful
representation of the action in terms of massless heat kernels, we are able to
obtain rigorous gauge invariant expansions, for both small and large fermion
masses, of its separate parity even and odd parts in arbitrary dimension. The
representation also displays both the nonperturbative origin of a finite
renormalization ambiguity, and its physical resolution by requiring decoupling
at infinite mass. Finally, we illustrate these general results by explicit
computation of the effective action for some physical examples of field

treatment of D-branes in arbitrary CFT backgrounds. In this work, we develop
boundary deformation theory in order to study the changes of boundary
conditions generated by marginal boundary fields. The deformation parameters
may be regarded as continuous moduli of D-branes. We identify a large class of
boundary fields which are shown to be truly marginal, and we derive closed
formulas describing the associated deformations to all orders in perturbation
theory. This allows us to study the global topology properties of the moduli
space rather than local aspects only. As an example, we analyse in detail the

9504145,1995,"It is argued that black hole condensation can occur at conifold singularities
in the moduli space of type II Calabi--Yau string vacua. The condensate signals
a smooth transition to a new Calabi--Yau space with different Euler
characteristic and Hodge numbers. In this manner string theory unifies the
moduli spaces of many or possibly all Calabi--Yau vacua. Elementary string
states and black holes are smoothly interchanged under the transitions, and
therefore cannot be invariantly distinguished. Furthermore, the transitions

three-fold near a conifold singularity in terms of intersecting D-branes. In
particular we study the singularity structure of higher derivative $F$-terms of

9807041,1998,"A computational scheme is developed to determine the response of a quantum
field theory (QFT) with a factorized scattering operator under a variation of
the Unruh temperature. To this end a new family of integrable systems is
introduced, obtained by deforming such QFTs in a way that preserves the
bootstrap S-matrix. The deformation parameter \beta plays the role of an
inverse temperature for the thermal equilibrium states associated with the
Rindler wedge, \beta = 2\pi being the QFT value. The form factor approach
provides an explicit computational scheme for the \beta \neq 2\pi systems,

9410104,1994,"The S--duality transformations of the lowest order string effective theory
admit a space time interpretation for 4-dim backgrounds with one Killing
symmetry. Starting from pure gravity and performing a sequence of intertwined
T-S-T duality transformations we obtain new solutions which are always pure
gravitational. In this fashion, S-duality induces an $SL(2,R)$ transformation
in the space of target space metrics which coincides with the action of the
Ehlers-Geroch group and interchanges the electric with the magnetic aspects of
gravity. Specializing to gravitational instanton backgrounds we show that ALE
instantons are mapped to (multi) Taub-NUT backgrounds and vice-versa. We find,
however, that the self-duality of the metric is not generically preserved,
unless the corresponding Killing vector field has self-dual covariant
derivatives. Thus, the T-S-T transformations are not always compatible with the
world-sheet supersymmetry of $N=4$ superconformal string vacua. We also provide
an algebraic characterization of the corresponding obstruction and associate it
with a breakdown of space time supersymmetry under rotational T-duality

9906057,1999,"We examine a class of gauge theories obtained by projecting out certain
fields from an N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory. These theories are
non-supersymmetric and in the large N limit are known to be conformal. Recently
it was proposed that the hierarchy problem could be solved by embedding the
standard model in a theory of this kind with finite N. In order to check this
claim one must find the conformal points of the theory. To do this we calculate
the one-loop beta functions for the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings. We
find that with the beta functions set to zero the one-loop quadratic
divergences are not canceled at sub-leading order in N; thus the hierarchy
between the weak scale and the Planck scale is not stabilized unless N is of

9606075,1996,"The generating functionals for the local composite operators, $\Phi^2(x)$ and
$\Phi^4(x)$, are used to study excitations in the scalar quantum field theory
with $\lambda \Phi^4$ interaction. The effective action for the composite
operators is obtained as a series in the Planck constant $\hbar$, and the two-
and four-particle propagators are derived. The numerical results are studied in
the space-time of one dimension, when the theory is equivalent to the quantum
mechanics of an anharmonic oscillator. The effective potential and the poles of
the composite propagators are obtained as series in $\hbar$, with effective
mass and coupling determined by non-perturbative gap equations. This provides a
systematic approximation method for the ground state energy, and for the second
and fourth excitations. The results show quick convergence to the exact values,
better than that obtained without including the operator $\Phi^4$.",0.10535295,-0.09917785,0.17278549,-0.15516764,0.16748518,-0.12776572,-0.1747359,0.37416112,-0.20587972,-0.036871858,0.1653273,0.11457195,0.061699122,-0.023767829,-0.38445282,-0.036843717,0.024494894,-0.32930154,0.17828025,-0.06915265,-0.3741393,0.21854347,-0.22536379,0.1989888,0.4385478,-0.06538628,0.16731903,-0.3481825,0.015780827,0.16723746,-0.1558617,0.18721317,0.09919356,-0.13938609,-0.419314,0.18400645,-0.3393768,0.08982,-0.09191391,0.08371785,-0.42775112,0.29064885,-0.4934531,-0.14141122,0.42098987,0.0003052391,-0.25201425,-0.09238476,-0.013270441,-0.26462272,0.2786398,-0.038307287,-0.47075933,-0.3126744,-0.3476695,-0.05190459,-0.18015851,-0.04244013,0.23206708,-0.40118837,0.17443323,0.043761864,-0.11420738,0.18335743,0.18232095,0.2067637,-0.099143825,-0.32969806,0.12156123,0.36292708,0.16555193,0.12575018,0.18775204,-0.1671673,0.041216843,0.082824156,-0.14170611,0.03295692,0.48042628,-0.5032048,-0.09247424,-0.30262578,0.043375984,-0.17919281,0.0049786717,-0.53006756,0.2877166,0.10630639,0.21570864,0.2258873,0.14332703,0.09126687,-0.15884784,-0.44880038,-0.66207457,-0.07746525,-0.18000248,-0.13612717,0.0037314668,-0.24204856,-0.29506508,-0.17170697,-0.271956,-0.18757167,0.11585347,-0.053826436,-0.28322065,-0.17172788,-0.19679545,0.6555774,0.15486951,-0.23156294,-0.033837765,0.10555337,0.33544493,-0.0039575547,-0.025101215,-0.104971945,-0.055345565,0.19836529,0.40828672,0.1822296,-0.049966834,0.06468459,0.16717371,0.15850279,0.11871833,0.47426382

9512079,1995,"A general construction is found for `topological' singular vectors of the
twisted N=2 superconformal algebra. It demonstrates many parallels with the
known construction for sl(2) singular vectors due to Malikov--Feigin--Fuchs,
but is formulated independently of the latter. The two constructions taken
together provide an isomorphism between topological and sl(2)- singular
vectors. The general formula for topological singular vectors can be
reformulated as a chain of direct recursion relations that allow one to derive
a given singular vector |S(r,s)> from the lower ones |S(r,s'<s)>. We also

9603061,1996,"We derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for four-dimensional
Reissner-Nordstrom extremal black holes in type II string theory. The
derivation is performed in two separate (T-dual) weak coupling pictures. One
uses a type IIB bound state problem of D5- and D1-branes, while the other uses
a bound state problem of D0- and D4-branes with macroscopic fundamental type

9612250,1996,"Among various approaches in proving gauge independence, models containing an
explicit gauge dependence are convenient. The well-known example is the gauge
parameter in the covariant gauge fixing which is of course most suitable for
the perturbation theory but a negative metric prevents us from imaging a
dynamical picture. Noncovariant gauge such as the Coulomb gauge is on the
contrary used for many physical situations. Therefore it is desirable to
include both cases. More than ten years ago, Steinmann introduced a function
(distribution) which can play this role in his attempt on discussing quantum
electrodynamics (QED) in terms of the gauge invariant fields solely. The method
is, however, broken down in the covariant case: the invariant operators are
ill-defined because of 1/p^2 singularity in the Minkowski space. In this paper,
we apply his function to the path integral: utilizing the arbitrariness of the
function we first restrict it to be able to have a well- defined operator, and
then a Hamiltonian with which we can build up the (Euclidean) path integral
formula. Although the formula is far from covariant, a full covariant
expression is recovered by reviving the components which have been discarded
under the construction of the Hamiltonian. There is no pathological defects
contrary to the operator formalism. With the aid of the path integral formula,
the gauge independence of the free energy as well as the S-matrix is proved.
Moreover the reason is clarified why it is so simple and straightforward to
argue gauge transformations in the path integral. Discussions on the quark
confinement is also presented.",0.1516556,-0.033244852,0.18110579,-0.16443473,0.29826224,0.26548916,-0.07871328,0.12827872,0.20151886,0.26725504,0.11022823,-0.20465446,-0.16334093,-0.119170785,0.10593395,-0.1604669,0.13519394,-0.15810618,0.020124659,0.04544749,0.114022925,0.09010431,0.17181002,-0.2668111,-0.046024315,-0.1163444,-0.29461187,0.3588335,-0.021666553,-0.23624091,0.06211237,0.31426615,-0.14471945,0.22818159,-0.049524162,0.13003074,-0.222804,0.00392323,-0.057504594,0.10789793,0.06273282,-0.08851367,0.038647622,-0.007490605,-0.032593578,-0.14981212,0.35209668,-0.18193635,0.03354522,0.33639622,-0.032966718,-0.22701463,-0.048760995,0.17230268,0.103523485,0.1192037,-0.044728175,-0.12167376,0.41665307,0.2659284,0.30496287,0.03084527,-0.23779996,-0.19304655,0.40894717,-0.032894954,0.01652186,-0.15766829,-0.22420782,-0.109203145,0.005001068,0.15435866,0.2782953,-0.0077780783,0.046564233,-0.23923028,0.0067427307,0.03084245,-0.19101867,0.12272885,0.10356401,0.03375653,-0.17943704,0.21052127,-0.1720811,0.026320785,0.03955528,0.027173273,-0.021000162,-0.180343,0.08107872,-0.029642656,-0.13287494,-0.04478256,0.039069965,0.121268034,-0.07899189,-0.279239,-0.0361729,0.13519226,-0.17552271,0.05029881,0.20682675,0.032057777,0.100324705,-0.10522647,-0.16765587,-0.052665606,0.16323939,0.051454622,0.10231431,-0.08938763,0.046009302,-0.12552598,-0.29826266,0.24472606,0.18238956,-0.0046019554,0.012907758,0.010507312,-0.2850682,-0.015094757,-0.3053694,-0.018582735,-0.04479462,-0.2469106,-0.016516417,-0.2616893

9710075,1997,"We present a method for computing the spectrum of black hole radiation of a
scalar field satisfying a wave equation with high frequency dispersion. The
method involves a combination of Laplace transform and WKB techniques for
finding approximate solutions to ordinary differential equations. The modified
wave equation is obtained by adding a higher order derivative term suppressed
by powers of a fundamental momentum scale $k_0$ to the ordinary wave equation.
Depending on the sign of this new term, high frequency modes propagate either
superluminally or subluminally. We show that the resulting spectrum of created
particles is thermal at the Hawking temperature, and further that the out-state
is a thermal state at the Hawking temperature, to leading order in $k_0$, for

9503170,1995,"The status of the gaugino condensation as the source of supersymmetry
breaking is reexamined. It is argued that one cannot have stable minima with
broken supersymmetry in models where the dilaton is coupled only linearly to
the gaugino condensate. We show that the problems of the gaugino condensate
mechanism can be solved by considering nonstandard gauge kinetic functions,
created by nonperturbative effects. As an example we use the principle of
S-duality to modify the coupling of the gaugino condensate to effective
supergravity (superstring) Lagrangians. We show that such an approach can solve
the problem of the runaway dilaton and lead to satisfactory supersymmetry
breaking in models with a {\em single} gaugino condensate. We exhibit a general
property of theories containing a symmetry acting on the dilaton and also shed
some light on the question whether it is generically the auxiliary field of the
modulus $T$, which dominates supersymmetry breaking.",-0.2189492,0.18681039,-0.0028050886,-0.07142793,0.24958694,-0.039237708,0.0018593222,0.10931505,0.037798822,0.04637146,-0.053040177,0.25243562,-0.11145032,-0.19624825,-0.096003264,0.058374047,0.27358487,0.101339325,-0.23808672,0.25679237,0.13857071,-0.099211276,-0.05081275,-0.15441617,0.2835777,0.0034751669,0.21200275,0.205645,0.066726476,-0.14645961,0.042604756,-0.11687758,0.13927025,-0.19987461,0.12242647,0.17428729,-0.07859109,0.0406477,-0.2295249,0.10850702,0.010728419,-0.09643742,0.051814135,-0.031330228,-0.08075951,-0.16600156,0.4223208,0.09478937,-0.501118,0.044660002,0.20073786,0.006642141,-0.09158915,-0.1263228,-0.070225075,0.1250296,0.17934513,0.045478076,0.20315884,0.0612473,0.028497592,0.07029085,-0.06529146,-0.116778255,-0.023306265,-0.06392176,0.08613196,0.1941649,-0.11074507,0.24314627,-0.042614326,0.15589637,-0.03826627,-0.12670349,0.008732304,-0.036213975,0.06684053,0.22244225,-0.30350602,0.056453068,-0.09971726,-0.06240093,0.07027529,-0.03489442,-0.0042074323,0.06260021,0.18353114,-0.063935466,0.25139788,-0.231499,0.12235554,-0.1421349,0.12107749,0.012634128,-0.0072105206,-0.083120964,-0.13802509,-0.28171682,-0.007638626,0.031042952,0.12266417,0.13893577,-0.07055259,0.13466655,-0.10462682,-0.060571775,-0.19172646,0.1932532,0.0005123392,0.048434794,-0.018614858,-0.06790121,-0.07511555,0.07200831,-0.11162556,-0.0630533,-0.15287925,-0.0032258183,-0.1551547,-0.17013052,-0.18043478,0.31442636,-0.21062459,-0.020288259,-0.20720558,-0.21061951,-0.037225507,-0.09965484

9612205,1996,"We reconsider differential geometry from the point of view of the quantum
theory of non-relativistic spinning particles, which provides examples of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This enables us to encode geometrical
structure in algebraic data consisting of an algebra of functions on a manifold
and a family of supersymmetry generators represented on a Hilbert space. We
show that known types of differential geometry can be classified in terms of
the supersymmetries they exhibit. Replacing commutative algebras of functions
by non-commutative *-algebras of operators, while retaining supersymmetry, we
arrive at a formulation of non-commutative geometry encompassing and extending
Connes' original approach. We explore different types of non-commutative
geometry and introduce notions of non-commutative manifolds and non-commutative
phase spaces. One of the main motivations underlying our work is to construct
mathematical tools for novel formulations of quantum gravity, in particular for
the investigation of superstring vacua.",0.09428932,0.0015641442,-0.20652741,-0.27709204,-0.064929076,0.30615792,0.11439338,-0.1090909,-0.08687763,0.2611732,0.1257258,0.079778396,-0.096799076,0.06199393,-0.06806764,-0.028416194,-0.11635032,-0.057568908,-0.116328135,-0.024603153,-0.13926674,0.24976063,0.061946716,-0.14996478,0.1407327,0.035031177,0.19105701,0.11192231,0.058140185,-0.21060428,-0.12811607,0.019085214,0.04132329,-0.10704249,0.1478681,0.031818494,0.19154589,-0.053812727,-0.07901725,-0.108234316,-0.044782788,-0.22961819,-0.13000248,0.1000887,0.00090744346,-0.09097256,0.094359204,0.071833044,0.10878771,0.14827645,0.009213582,-0.4838089,0.04226079,-0.05896551,0.002283197,0.19231196,-0.049630724,-0.017556056,0.35928583,0.25725168,-0.07516365,0.1339274,0.2891392,-0.13058554,0.10675051,0.10121454,0.100874156,-0.18140426,-0.18345153,-0.1953377,0.1358156,0.3415066,0.059954673,0.08053478,-0.15002882,-0.05434598,-0.048794955,0.25871772,-0.18800947,0.13533117,-0.007089937,-0.27737042,0.14676444,-0.090643436,0.004304707,-0.018660992,-0.0066428557,-0.13610409,-0.04672122,-0.1182108,-0.029692452,0.104226284,-0.0062803477,-0.025656104,0.17014109,-0.11850405,-0.018597737,0.09180315,-0.02127932,0.04939046,0.18952501,0.14776678,0.36193794,0.14378442,0.08979213,-0.029088512,-0.09985152,-0.13708614,0.087560534,-0.14481437,-0.06748228,-0.040052053,0.2364374,0.07485857,-0.13476779,0.055243492,0.06448111,-0.044800192,-0.31172812,-0.12547457,-0.07867791,0.22063458,-0.07669312,-0.14568344,-0.16313058,-0.017660223,0.14504191,-0.09666856

coupled to matter multiplets. In analogy with the N=2 case also in the N=4 case
one can introduce Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.The associated three-parameters have
the meaning of momentum-map levels in a HyperK\""ahler quotient construction.
Differently from the N=2 case, however, the N=4 has a single phase
corresponding to an effective $\sigma$-model. There is no Landau-Ginzburg
phase. The main possible application of our N=4 model is to an effective
Lagrangian construction of a $\sigma$-model on ALE-manifolds. We discuss the A
and B topological twists of these models clarifying some issues not yet
discussed in the literature, in particular the identification of the
topological systems emerging from the twist. Applying our results to the case

9605049,1996,"We consider the propagation of Type I open superstrings on orbifolds with
four non-compact dimensions and $N=1$ supersymmetry. In this paper, we
concentrate on a non-trivial Z_2xZ_2 example. We show that consistency
conditions, arising from tadpole cancellation and algebraic sources, require
the existence of three sets of Dirichlet 5-branes. We discuss fully the
enhancements of the spectrum when these 5-branes intersect. An amusing

9910129,1999,"In continuum physics, there are important topological aspects like
instantons, theta-terms and the axial anomaly. Conventional lattice
discretizations often have difficulties in treating one or the other of these
aspects. In this paper, we develop discrete quantum field theories on fuzzy
manifolds using noncommutative geometry. Basing ourselves on previous
treatments of instantons and chiral fermions (without fermion doubling) on
fuzzy spaces and especially fuzzy spheres, we present discrete representations

9910111,1999,"Six dimensional supergravities on $ADS_3 \times S^3$ present interest due to
the role they play in the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. The correspondence in this
case states the equivalence between supergravity on the given background and a
still unknown conformal field theory. The conformal field theory in question is
expected to appear by deforming of the free conformal field theory on
$S^N(T^4)$ in a way which preserves the superconformal symmetry. The purpose of
this paper is to compute the first nontrivial corrections to the equations of
motion for the chiral primary fields coming from supergravity. Using the
methods already developed which involve nontrivial redefinitions of fields, we
compute three-point correlation functions for scalar chiral primaries and
notice similarities between their expressions and those obtained in the
orbifold conformal field theory.",-0.07218808,0.21194157,0.10551606,0.06403288,-0.04077398,0.063064754,0.03212735,0.009886518,0.1477364,0.10545407,-0.019597985,0.019922256,0.23796278,0.17925844,0.07068153,-0.1229322,-0.09917207,0.00885237,0.12159273,-0.04633665,-0.26543793,0.26458997,0.14568801,-0.28163803,-0.29343376,0.16223095,0.20567238,-0.002255843,-0.15024634,0.21079102,0.010591671,0.03966862,-0.22220927,-0.061966464,-0.062572524,-0.023183905,0.13147625,0.23363638,0.016728286,0.35149765,-0.30915883,0.0031803548,-0.23974416,-0.25839648,0.25220078,0.20362023,-0.15110224,0.008169148,0.026715852,-0.073161036,0.03292622,-0.10722786,0.08023633,-0.24070874,0.05191751,-0.32259816,-0.10680546,-0.16387773,0.25708959,0.2733032,-0.01886873,0.22649518,0.1534777,-0.046447642,0.061888084,-0.022091389,-0.14881796,-0.1355429,0.027421623,-0.3162813,0.045534983,-0.073975325,0.066687495,-0.13100937,0.03066124,-0.037495367,-0.14090234,0.31144202,0.1264672,-0.095007695,0.048592646,-0.0752583,-0.11676198,0.020409107,0.40897837,0.20074213,0.23540968,0.2811416,-0.057177193,-0.14978941,-0.18800187,-0.034250386,-0.13348572,0.03292119,-0.14814079,-0.15391496,0.06931476,0.1973385,-0.020670546,0.06808142,0.020886749,0.16855884,0.0651512,0.0056706294,-0.091659665,0.14208394,0.15285572,-0.024744932,-0.0102194995,-0.058592804,0.10724199,0.05083935,0.3769135,-0.09636241,-0.17426005,0.0018238835,0.036706872,-0.039184153,-0.26074868,-0.26760674,-0.0080102235,0.16536602,0.081566736,-0.095323786,-0.02833505,0.20256242,-0.03344728,-0.20287003

or anti-self-dual instanton equation in n-dimensions can be defined in terms of
a closed (n-4) form $\Omega$ and it was recently employed as a topological
gauge fixing condition in higher dimensional generalizations of cohomological
Yang-Mills theory. When $\Omega$ is a calibration which is naturally introduced
on the manifold of special holomony, we argue that higher dimensional instanton
may be locally characterized as a family of four dimensional instantons over a
supersymmetric (n-4) cycle $\Sigma$ with respect to the calibration $\Omega$.

broken down to a subalgebra in any spacetime background. For given toroidal
backgrounds, the unbroken gauge symmetries (corresponding to holomorphic and

algebras of null 2-tori. A minimal Lie algebraic closure containing all the

The underlying symmetries act on the ground ring of functions on $T^{4,4}$ as

spacetime action valid for noncompact metrics is presented, whose symmetries

9501094,1995,"I study the time--symmetric initial--data problem in theories with a massless
scalar field (dilaton), free or coupled to a Maxwell field in the stringy way,
finding different initial--data sets describing an arbitrary number of black
holes with arbitrary masses, charges and asymptotic value of the dilaton. The
presence of the scalar field gives rise to a number of interesting effects. The
mass and charges of a single black hole are different in its two asymptotically
flat regions across the Einstein--Rosen bridge. The same happens to the value
of the dilaton at infinity. This forbids the identification of these asymptotic
regions in order to build (Misner) wormholes in the most naive way. Using
different techniques, I find regular initial data for stringy wormholes. The
price payed is the existence singularities in the dilaton field. The presence
of a single--valued scalar seems to constrain strongly the allowed topologies
of the initial space--like surface. Other kinds of scalar fields (taking values
on a circle or being defined up to an additive constant) are also briefly

9804014,1998,"For a Calabi-Yau threefold admitting both a $K3$ fibration and an elliptic
fibration (with some extra conditions) we discuss candidate asymptotic
expressions of the genus 0 and 1 Gromov-Witten potentials in the limit
(possibly corresponding to the perturbative regime of a heterotic string) where
the area of the base of the $K3$ fibration is very large. The expressions are
constructed by lifting procedures using nearly holomorphic Weyl-invariant
Jacobi forms. The method we use is similar to the one introduced by Borcherds
for the constructions of automorphic forms on type IV domains as infinite
products and employs in an essential way the elliptic polylogarithms of
Beilinson and Levin. In particular, if we take a further limit where the base
of the elliptic fibration decompactifies, the Gromov-Witten potentials are
expressed simply by these elliptic polylogarithms. The theta correspondence
considered by Harvey and Moore which they used to extract the expression for
the perturbative prepotential is closely related to the Eisenstein-Kronecker
double series and hence the real versions of elliptic polylogarithms introduced
by Zagier.",-0.020198576,-0.2805447,0.16133109,-0.2505141,0.099230066,0.120485276,-0.18864048,-0.066847995,0.035417706,0.1560404,0.013894942,-0.07071992,-0.39190593,-0.12590168,0.06917056,-0.07123709,0.15026215,0.05638374,0.081245594,0.28835315,-0.092490986,0.27453667,0.33843127,0.06985421,0.11944084,0.036749907,0.072133735,0.096505314,0.13284521,-0.1104781,-0.20106725,-0.24324606,0.09072593,-0.11567271,0.016928088,0.0074265897,0.05334893,-0.14872292,0.015055969,-0.15550296,0.41041017,-0.21454015,0.26724893,0.113645054,0.08907822,0.0013222881,-0.08716416,0.089046106,-0.09157644,0.15870295,0.046894804,-0.055394996,-0.04477328,0.20445299,-0.24490683,-0.06758921,0.23642367,-0.05425261,0.26933557,-0.03510634,0.11423649,0.036359057,0.04368355,0.15889615,0.04164891,0.32389134,0.29823822,0.19701268,0.14405003,-0.087671086,-0.1110523,0.21623173,0.21263722,0.39343143,-0.102363,-0.24402198,0.32206365,0.20469898,-0.24312173,0.12993084,-0.30611846,-0.24848168,0.14535931,0.13440084,-0.04721783,0.27151608,-0.0047379285,0.10445614,-0.103483625,-0.006005548,0.10364081,-0.037878975,-0.11882539,-0.12198708,0.090525225,0.10486342,-0.016295448,-0.12885088,0.054764356,0.14614269,-0.063645735,0.04006031,-0.13623805,-0.087008,0.14092946,-0.18941632,-0.14057371,0.12412633,0.059652496,-0.31450006,-0.018760785,0.04463373,0.14498053,0.02529557,-0.10660165,0.0788214,-0.17834182,0.08394627,0.11853291,0.1720644,0.007890716,0.25032517,-0.16348091,0.3645919,-0.015958935,0.31918147,0.3107714,-0.043406576
9809127,1998,"The Equivalence Principle (EP), stating that all physical systems are
connected by a coordinate transformation to the free one with vanishing energy,
univocally leads to the Quantum Stationary HJ Equation (QSHJE). Trajectories
depend on the Planck length through hidden variables which arise as initial
conditions. The formulation has manifest p-q duality, a consequence of the
involutive nature of the Legendre transform and of its recently observed
relation with second-order linear differential equations. This reflects in an
intrinsic psi^D-psi duality between linearly independent solutions of the
Schroedinger equation. Unlike Bohm's theory, there is a non-trivial action even
for bound states. No use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave-function
is made. Tunnelling is a direct consequence of the quantum potential which
differs from the usual one and plays the role of particle's self-energy. The
QSHJE is defined only if the ratio psi^D/psi is a local self-homeomorphism of
the extended real line. This is an important feature as the L^2 condition,
which in the usual formulation is a consequence of the axiomatic interpretation
of the wave-function, directly follows as a basic theorem which only uses the
geometrical gluing conditions of psi^D/psi at q=\pm\infty as implied by the EP.
As a result, the EP itself implies a dynamical equation that does not require
any further assumption and reproduces both tunnelling and energy quantization.

9310119,1993,"Using $U_q[SU(2)]$ tensor calculus we compute the two-point scalar operators
(TPSO), their averages on the ground-state give the two-point correlation
functions. The TPSOs are identified as elements of the Temperley-Lieb algebra
and a recurrence relation is given for them. We have not tempted to derive the
analytic expressions for the correlation functions in the general case but got
some partial results. For $q=e^{i \pi/3}$, all correlation functions are
(trivially) zero, for $q=e^{i \pi/4}$, they are related in the continuum to the
correlation functions of left-handed and right-handed Majorana fields in the
half plane coupled by the boundary condition. In the case $q=e^{i \pi/6}$, one

9411174,1994,"The connection between space-time covariant representations (obtained by
inducing from the Lorentz group) and irreducible unitary representations
(induced from Wigner's little group) of the Poincar\'{e} group is re-examined
in the massless case. In the situation relevant to physics, it is found that
these are related by Marsden-Weinstein reduction with respect to a gauge group.
An analogous phenomenon is observed for classical massless relativistic
particles. This symplectic reduction procedure can be (`second') quantized
using a generalization of the Rieffel induction technique in operator algebra
theory, which is carried through in detail for electro- magnetism. Starting
from the so-called Fermi representation of the field algebra generated by the
free abelian gauge field, we construct a new (`rigged') sesquilinear form on
the representation space, which is positive semi-definite, and given in terms
of a Gaussian weak distribution (promeasure) on the gauge group (taken to be a
Hilbert Lie group). This eventually constructs the algebra of observables of
quantum electro- magnetism (directly in its vacuum representation) as a
representation of the so-called algebra of weak observables induced by the
trivial representation of the gauge group.",-0.40523395,-0.15810029,0.124667734,-0.053564012,-0.34426218,0.16781643,0.46648803,0.69320345,0.12330705,-0.7392976,-0.0862948,-0.032293975,-0.16849631,0.02989833,-0.39474818,0.75302124,0.11580631,-0.3417701,-0.52007943,-0.5192715,-0.12650126,0.5080726,-0.014064431,0.2627697,0.24431397,0.18380335,-0.19492206,-0.3072136,0.56514513,0.091982305,0.19028504,-0.05981265,-0.13060147,-0.3593979,0.18193509,0.19658132,0.07633558,0.5467192,0.14149229,-0.12578486,0.34116873,0.43237922,0.29545826,-0.63383895,0.35925263,-0.007811792,-0.21143767,0.13262194,0.23837456,0.22236468,0.28905293,0.36894327,0.16658027,0.10092856,0.19081691,-0.44215018,0.042719096,-0.35680702,-0.013389409,0.20108461,0.14571851,0.04904765,0.6633154,-0.024619754,-0.039216667,0.06393078,-0.44570255,0.07111083,0.5575056,-0.17458694,0.03251943,0.31071132,-0.45571277,0.28167114,-0.27401817,-0.13558215,-0.08003014,0.59470385,-0.08711094,0.10815124,-0.0847204,-0.5242841,0.38904592,0.26212546,-0.0848645,0.026478432,0.17877848,-0.19965473,0.21726204,0.0052977353,0.20920353,-0.24225517,0.0128925145,0.3138458,-0.2909989,-0.080607936,-0.08605918,0.09298171,-0.3225379,0.09286378,0.19855216,-0.0068370467,-0.23794302,0.1035867,0.4255046,-0.3729378,0.021643013,0.24571416,-0.25388741,-0.21948987,0.6618702,0.3757356,0.17005205,-0.44812852,-0.06090724,0.41499004,-0.6210681,-0.0021353066,-0.21287763,0.1331928,0.39901862,0.28077722,0.27762663,0.2520331,-0.07077834,0.06683636,-0.034097396,0.4845823

9805114,1998,"The correspondence between string theory in Anti-de Sitter space and super
Yang Mills theory is an example of the Holographic principle according to which
a quantum theory with gravity must be describable by a boundary theory.
However, arguments given so far are incomplete because, while the bulk theory
has been related to a boundary theory, the holographic bound saying that the
boundary theory has only one bit of information per Planck area has not been
justified. We show here that this bound is the physical interpretation of one
of the unusual aspects of the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter space and
the boundary conformal field theory, which is that infrared effects in the bulk
theory are reflected as ultraviolet effects in the boundary theory.",-0.17972666,0.05932506,-0.075703576,-0.11545631,0.119804874,0.25648272,-0.110613406,-0.053139273,0.09024282,0.08946633,-0.15089652,-0.180085,0.01669881,-0.21589342,0.097038925,-0.07603735,0.02650033,0.083569355,0.1053298,0.0074588573,-0.11267286,0.17830813,-0.11911657,0.19320385,0.04978635,0.12668729,0.034555018,-0.063421585,0.22768396,-0.061987966,0.00928323,-0.06353686,-0.18302326,0.108379036,0.015816139,0.025045367,-0.06646721,-0.2513615,0.07072116,0.13089117,-0.18203902,-0.39720267,0.055366963,0.10066267,-0.16014576,0.10723977,0.24855193,0.17772216,-0.038289256,0.13003622,0.15370743,0.10060125,0.018601134,-0.10099976,0.052167956,-0.10762135,-0.12850365,-0.08176555,0.31756842,0.007519584,-0.015654072,-0.07513754,-0.09728306,0.11425163,0.0032163411,0.05807866,0.15727752,0.06933051,-0.07236445,-0.1772182,-0.024507277,0.24065642,0.16510344,0.06857889,-0.019692773,-0.076052584,0.09108992,0.1654172,-0.122148044,-0.037039533,-0.0221373,-0.14755693,0.12079464,0.28503948,0.1144162,0.101345934,-0.03710752,0.0058975294,0.10447559,-0.07356475,0.16357318,0.0610445,0.08888629,-0.05653678,0.018613957,0.021673366,-0.061331958,-0.19523817,0.004928492,-0.17061454,0.0077326894,-0.0034759045,-0.12695915,0.12669596,0.0758578,0.008737959,-0.06383427,0.030682154,-0.06927481,-0.15760326,0.13393153,-0.1341657,0.29702815,-0.11051733,-0.11367304,-0.12937629,-0.07909997,0.21562779,0.098389685,-0.056867637,-0.123442054,-0.012322828,-0.055544913,0.065319076,-0.08566263,0.02351129,0.0048838407,0.022051618

9607168,1996,"From the equivalence of the bosonic and fermionic representations of
finitized characters in conformal field theory, one can extract mathematical
objects known as Bailey pairs. Recently Berkovich, McCoy and Schilling have
constructed a `generalized' character formula depending on two parameters $\ra$
and $\r2$, using the Bailey pairs of the unitary model $M(p-1,p)$. By taking
appropriate limits of these parameters, they were able to obtain the characters
of model $M(p,p+1)$, $N=1$ model $SM(p,p+2)$, and the unitary $N=2$ model with
central charge $c=3(1-{\frac{2}{p}})$. In this letter we computed the effective

9606057,1996,"String duality requires the presence of solitonic $p$-branes. By contrast,
the existence of fundamental supermembranes is problematic, since they are
probably unstable. In this paper, we re-examine the quantum stability of
fundamental supermembranes in 11 dimensions. Previously, supermembranes were
shown to be unstable by approximating them with SU(n) super Yang-Mills fields
as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We show that this instability persists even if we
quantize the continuum theory from the very beginning. Second, we speculate how
a theory of decaying membranes may still be physically relevant. We present
some heuristic arguments showing that light membranes may be too short-lived to
be detected, while very massive membranes, with longer lifetimes, may have only
very weak coupling to the particles we see in nature. Either way, decaying
membranes would not be detectable in the lab. (This article is to be published

9904095,1999,"We investigate further our recent proposal for the form of the matrix theory
action in weak background fields. Using Seiberg's scaling argument we relate
the matrix theory action to a low-energy system of many D0-branes in an
arbitrary but weak NS-NS and R-R background. The resulting multiple D0-brane
action agrees with the known Born-Infeld action in the case of a single brane
and gives an explicit formulation of many additional terms which appear in the
multiple brane action. The linear coupling to an arbitrary background metric
satisfies the nontrivial consistency condition suggested by Douglas that the
masses of off-diagonal fields are given by the geodesic distance between the
corresponding pair of D0-branes. This agreement arises from combinatorial
factors which depend upon the symmetrized trace ordering prescription found
earlier for higher moments of the matrix theory stress-energy tensor. We study
the effect of a weak background metric on two graviton interactions and find
that our formalism agrees with the results expected from supergravity. The

9202054,1992,"The recently proposed loop representation, used previously to find exact
solutions to the quantum constraints of general relativity, is here used to
quantize linearized general relativity. The Fock space of graviton states and
its associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionals
of loops. The ``reality conditions'' are realized by an inner product that is
chiral asymmetric, resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for the
Hamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handed
gravitons. This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of the
linearized field into self-dual and anti-self dual parts rather than into
positive and negative frequency parts; as the former, but not the latter, is
meaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful in
connecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory. The formalism
depends on an arbitrary ``averaging'' function that controls certain
divergences, but does not appear in the final physical quantities. Inspite of
these somewhat unusual features, the loop quntization presented here is
completely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity.",0.11161702,0.21736477,0.15518042,0.083637744,-0.11663002,0.16089034,-0.03193081,0.041618288,0.06850052,0.12949315,0.017162383,0.30174622,0.09574765,0.20739701,0.16528423,0.18286234,0.05386247,0.18179072,0.12479598,-0.11416384,-0.1146612,-0.1506234,-0.079255864,0.37498367,-0.13006374,0.15326166,-0.023624822,-0.020170867,0.013433866,-0.07995835,-0.20794132,0.16290212,-0.17597073,0.1288921,0.015739784,-0.4433331,-0.027007252,0.052755296,0.111250535,0.20227003,-0.0029036775,0.09203732,0.10985686,-0.13813105,-0.16502804,-0.14096868,0.02974999,-0.22070846,0.06962371,0.13277072,0.016638953,0.28239337,0.1004843,-0.11638897,0.26052892,-0.26518965,0.17877457,-0.33632928,0.116642594,0.02272507,-0.030504733,0.19363692,-0.014146052,0.19532257,0.13685504,-0.18697195,0.13839811,-0.2531797,-0.09956442,-0.24017222,0.35759982,0.13509603,-0.10366112,0.12920938,-0.13275616,0.01981828,-0.2771713,0.2508788,-0.05033533,-0.10062869,-0.04566992,0.17491841,0.071973145,0.024081439,0.3345164,-0.08631265,0.23920736,0.1504315,-0.07926144,-0.39841822,-0.005577363,-0.011250615,0.03915727,-0.019352201,0.14322287,-0.042600237,0.020787966,-0.013528019,0.10850903,-0.07728423,0.19107473,-0.10246521,-0.01826256,-0.13490447,0.079904586,0.1694229,-0.13654655,-0.2507696,-0.21689367,-0.13802433,0.15754709,-0.16151924,0.23469757,-0.06761424,-0.008457242,0.01047159,-0.115713276,0.15757264,-0.022527024,0.14469858,-0.21422242,0.013060376,-0.2412307,-0.05373626,-0.13672468,-0.13195351,-0.17850405,-0.30675775

The effective potential is calculated in leading order in $1/N_f$ ($N_f$ is the
number of fermion flavors) and used to describe the features of the phase
transition at $N_f=N_{\rm cr}$, $3<N_{\rm cr}<5$. It is shown that this
continuous phase transition satisfies the criteria of the conformal phase
transition, considered recently in the literature. In particular, there is an
abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations at the critical point,
although the phase transition is continuous, and the structure of the equation
for the divergence of the dilatation current is essentially different in the
symmetric and nonsymmetric phases. The connection of this dynamics with the

9808106,1998,"Quons are particles characterized by the parameter $q$, which permits smooth
interpolation between Bose and Fermi statistics; $q=1$ gives bosons, $q=-1$
gives fermions.
  In this paper we give a heuristic argument for an extension of conservation
of statistics to quons with trilinear couplings of the form $\bar{f}fb$, where
$f$ is fermion-like and $b$ is boson-like. We show that $q_f^2=q_b$. In
particular, we relate the bound on $q_{\gamma}$ for photons to the bound on

9801098,1998,"Starting from the known representation of the partition function of the 2-
and 3-D Ising models as an integral over Grassmann variables, we perform a
hopping expansion of the corresponding Pfaffian. We show that this expansion is
an exact, algebraic representation of the loop- and surface expansions (with
intrinsic geometry) of the 2- and 3-D Ising models. Such an algebraic calculus
is much simpler to deal with than working with the geometrical objects. For the
2-D case we show that the algebra of hopping generators allows a simple
algebraic treatment of the geometry factors and counting problems, and as a
result we obtain the corrected loop expansion of the free energy. We compute
the radius of convergence of this expansion and show that it is determined by
the critical temperature. In 3-D the hopping expansion leads to the surface
representation of the Ising model in terms of surfaces with intrinsic geometry.
Based on a representation of the 3-D model as a product of 2-D models coupled
to an auxiliary field, we give a simple derivation of the geometry factor which
prevents overcounting of surfaces and provide a classification of possible sets
of surfaces to be summed over. For 2- and 3-D we derive a compact formula for
2n-point functions in loop (surface) representation.",0.18396373,0.099264905,0.016968172,0.014755834,-0.0016021719,-0.095776774,0.17008196,0.052853324,-0.1387565,0.02960939,0.006393552,0.090152256,0.23913512,-0.0027875947,0.15595235,0.07155597,-0.047799326,0.098768115,0.1257752,0.12338692,0.023588017,0.07992479,0.03748502,0.077718586,-0.052742034,-0.11581569,-0.040050536,-0.009966027,0.014843432,0.1760823,0.009399489,0.06560319,0.0018741414,-0.1457348,-0.14082299,0.14111224,0.04449912,-0.09447886,-0.085383385,0.012804886,-0.045378108,0.01603894,0.10618335,0.25452182,0.16051346,-0.010741644,0.013253294,-0.13885602,0.05538574,-0.1723849,-0.0983148,0.025615769,-0.14766826,0.054422617,0.01273587,0.3327998,0.02728837,0.06162584,-0.13792932,0.17625968,-0.029320039,0.19082513,0.008173652,-0.064818695,-0.083629355,0.018239059,0.016164128,-0.013063282,0.11502716,0.018970966,-0.016677778,0.033872534,-0.038390227,0.09404087,0.036399364,0.1567385,-0.10989347,-0.1829052,0.08509368,0.034932517,-0.015650399,0.007540535,-0.16801372,-0.11435082,-0.2322871,-0.23603566,-0.04873439,-0.0701679,0.09470539,0.065326355,-0.047852457,0.06759782,0.06289029,-0.1405784,0.04010015,0.03516751,0.15277067,0.1079314,0.13129331,-0.06284026,-0.072599486,-0.07707845,0.12889245,0.00771109,-0.029899962,0.0066870153,-0.09063235,-0.10349154,0.12813362,0.13807335,-0.03161201,-0.059037168,-0.035038054,0.037546832,0.047603875,0.02626308,-0.033185914,-0.18813823,-0.08626794,0.23742256,0.097112484,0.07356004,0.053848647,-0.067012176,0.098299265,0.045626156,0.09198205,-0.08791415

9907139,1999,"The maximal center gauge, combined with center projection, is a means to
associate Yang-Mills lattice gauge configurations with closed center vortex
world-surfaces. This technique allows to study center vortex physics in lattice
gauge experiments. In the present work, the continuum analogue of the maximal
center gauge is constructed. This sheds new light on the meaning of the
procedure on the lattice and leads to a sketch of an effective vortex theory in
the continuum. Furthermore, the manner in which center vortex configurations
generate the Pontryagin index is investigated. The Pontryagin index is built up
from self-intersections of the vortex world-surfaces, where it is crucial that
the surfaces be globally non-oriented.",-0.14076848,-0.16568474,-0.13914764,-0.28781438,-0.29131272,0.1830872,0.031706877,-0.033087924,0.082822144,0.094574906,0.026394144,0.06162808,-0.19491954,-0.19880047,0.021907594,-0.10879162,-0.20999147,-0.093797855,-0.12980792,-0.12675731,0.08463645,0.2629378,0.040275328,-0.09975084,0.23671487,0.016349323,0.29684192,0.0660093,0.19130838,-0.018009245,-0.06073685,0.07503495,-0.21893805,-0.16426398,0.009663995,-0.23090741,0.058991224,-0.1670294,-0.16475934,-0.20758544,0.13574189,-0.03539651,-0.010130206,0.069461234,0.0030711591,-0.01379893,0.092761934,0.022380443,-0.02904883,0.17088775,-0.10149698,0.21969354,0.19820543,0.04372845,0.037603512,-0.27691364,0.28481582,0.0032687485,0.51604,0.08328818,-0.020004615,0.086321115,0.14946291,0.15008171,0.04552882,-0.18640476,-0.029325671,0.34509772,-0.10445359,-0.12839858,0.123144574,0.433768,0.027911618,0.20173469,0.21736869,-0.04293602,-0.25408942,-0.024173599,-0.09043624,0.1326519,0.33692878,-0.14256674,0.08152697,0.07911202,-0.18468127,0.045752987,-0.09354064,-0.008659586,-0.07395179,-0.14967303,-0.072245814,-0.05488827,0.08137044,0.2344258,-0.20209762,-0.0011848547,0.16170467,0.13936377,0.15437849,-0.0054096505,-0.10263096,-0.052860215,0.23179069,0.121713474,0.19116189,0.027546514,-0.1587152,-0.11046003,0.32322899,-0.054979414,0.11936988,0.048679523,0.07839508,-0.24742758,0.074098974,-0.149196,0.055608366,-0.06889622,-0.2764375,0.24757902,-0.08552815,0.16770384,-0.2322567,0.017201785,-0.204321,-0.18198504,0.086962864,0.062485963

9311156,1993,"I present a new class of topological string theories, and discuss them in two
dimensions as candidates for the string description of large-$N$ QCD. The
starting point is a new class of topological sigma models, whose path integral
is localized to the moduli space of harmonic maps from the worldsheet to the
target. The Lagrangian is of fourth order in worldsheet derivatives. After
gauging worldsheet diffeomorphisms in this ``harmonic topological sigma
model,'' we obtain a topological string theory dominated by minimal-area maps.
The bosonic part of this ``topological rigid string'' Lagrangian coincides with
the Lagrangian proposed by Polyakov for the QCD string in higher dimensions.

9812248,1998,"A general condition for sharp transition of decay rate from quantum to
thermal regimes is derived in dissipative tunneling models when position
dependent mass is involved. It is shown that the effect of dissipation in
general changes the order of the phase transition. Especially, for the models
with constant mass the Ohmic dissipation enlarges the range of parameters for
first-order phase transitions. In the case of second-order phase transition the

9511201,1995,"In these lecture notes, we present a self-contained discussion of planar
gauge theories broken down to some finite residual gauge group H via the Higgs
mechanism. The main focus is on the discrete H gauge theory describing the long
distance physics of such a model. The spectrum features global H charges,
magnetic vortices and dyonic combinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect,
these particles exhibit topological interactions. Among other things, we review
the Hopf algebra related to this discrete H gauge theory, which provides an
unified description of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the particles
in this model. Exotic phenomena such as flux metamorphosis, Alice fluxes,
Cheshire charge, (non)abelian braid statistics, the generalized spin-statistics
connection and nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering are explained and
illustrated by representative examples.

9503226,1995,"It has been suggested that a possible classical remnant of the phenomenon of
target-space duality (T-duality) would be the equivalence of the classical
string Hamiltonian systems. Given a simple compact Lie group $G$ with a
bi-invariant metric and a generating function $\Gamma$ suggested in the physics
literature, we follow the above line of thought and work out the canonical
transformation $\Phi$ generated by $\Gamma$ together with an $\Ad$-invariant
metric and a B-field on the associated Lie algebra $\frak g$ of $G$ so that $G$
and $\frak g$ form a string target-space dual pair at the classical level under
the Hamiltonian formalism. In this article, some general features of this

9811043,1998,"A complete set of Feynman rules is derived, which permits a perturbative
description of the nonequilibrium dynamics of a symmetry-breaking phase
transition in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in an expanding universe. In contrast to a
naive expansion in powers of the coupling constant, this approximation scheme
provides for (a) a description of the nonequilibrium state in terms of its own
finite-width quasiparticle excitations, thus correctly incorporating
dissipative effects in low-order calculations, and (b) the emergence from a
symmetric initial state of a final state exhibiting the properties of
spontaneous symmetry breaking, while maintaining the constraint $<\phi>\equiv
0$. Earlier work on dissipative perturbation theory and spontaneous symmetry
breaking in Minkowski spacetime is reviewed. The central problem addressed is
the construction of a perturbative approximation scheme which treats the
initial symmetric state in terms of the field $\phi$, while the state that
emerges at later times is treated in terms of a field $\zeta$, linearly related
to $\phi^2$. The connection between early and late times involves an infinite
sequence of composite propagators. Explicit one-loop calculations are given of
the gap equations that determine quasiparticle masses and of the equation of
motion for $<\phi^2(t)>$ and the renormalization of these equations is
described. The perturbation series needed to describe the symmetric and

9208006,1992,"Quantum matrices $A(R)$ are known for every $R$ matrix obeying the Quantum
Yang-Baxter Equations. It is also known that these act on `vectors' given by
the corresponding Zamalodchikov algebra. We develop this interpretation in
detail, distinguishing between two forms of this algebra, $V(R)$ (vectors) and
$V^*(R)$ (covectors). $A(R)\to V(R_{21})\tens V^*(R)$ is an algebra
homomorphism (i.e. quantum matrices are realized by the tensor product of a
quantum vector with a quantum covector), while the inner product of a quantum
covector with a quantum vector transforms as a scaler. We show that if $V(R)$
and $V^*(R)$ are endowed with the necessary braid statistics $\Psi$ then their
braided tensor-product $V(R)\und\tens V^*(R)$ is a realization of the braided
matrices $B(R)$ introduced previously, while their inner product leads to an
invariant quantum trace. Introducing braid statistics in this way leads to a
fully covariant quantum (braided) linear algebra. The braided groups obtained
from $B(R)$ act on themselves by conjugation in a way impossible for the
quantum groups obtained from $A(R)$.",-0.12185979,-0.14976063,0.15229057,-0.0507887,-0.21463977,0.12840919,0.06400037,-0.34208962,0.2535982,0.299882,-0.04939401,-0.22626162,-0.019091975,-0.009334356,0.11243394,-0.091392346,-0.04132103,-0.05230037,-0.017431606,-0.20816885,-0.029562883,0.07203823,-0.14508691,0.19977687,0.23879294,0.2682823,0.18040422,-0.055168886,0.048444875,0.13409156,-0.07428509,-0.007509485,-0.06224606,0.004053749,-0.061767053,0.011779522,-0.034079023,-0.11639223,-0.021123094,0.08389478,0.06498188,-0.038033187,-0.21350339,-0.08614285,-0.23940997,0.014963143,0.15678401,-0.1667062,0.17610261,0.11797409,0.14877993,0.051584635,-0.167647,0.057068318,0.111471996,-0.022766083,-0.003939854,0.040849596,0.13142309,-0.08699484,0.1870194,-0.06983501,0.027839266,0.027494565,0.13208504,-0.1360809,0.0145229185,-0.014306374,0.017045867,0.0034597367,0.12791203,0.1957606,0.06302506,0.10982013,0.057768688,-0.12421557,0.09251219,-0.04018542,-0.03462611,0.08908203,0.0074639767,0.0034270063,-0.10078432,0.032565758,-0.045913443,-0.11425494,0.011025019,-0.11823138,0.10124377,0.108429134,-0.034602426,0.09285714,0.045543924,0.08659618,0.011499822,-0.23474959,-0.17936802,0.21877837,-0.043910816,-0.037607122,0.15670076,0.13817585,0.120056644,-0.006786751,0.1380099,0.08966966,-0.31911328,0.043391496,-0.022353766,-0.0923744,0.045044392,-0.1231529,0.23777163,-0.15841314,-0.034413666,-0.0729905,0.001637368,0.15090337,-0.057026282,-0.017696783,0.1092549,0.02717498,-0.26309884,-0.17650287,-0.14569876,-0.06835948,0.015910167,-0.23479362
9410201,1994,"A construction is proposed for linear connections on non-commutative
algebras. The construction relies on a generalisation of the Leibnitz rules of
commutative geometry and uses the bimodule structure of $\Omega^1$. A special
role is played by the extension to the framework of non-commutative geometry of
the permutation of two copies of $\Omega^1$. The construction of the linear
connection as well as the definition of torsion and curvature is first proposed
in the setting of the derivations based differential calculus of Dubois-
Violette and then a generalisation to the framework proposed by Connes as well
as other non-commutative differential calculi is suggested. The covariant

of $\Omega^1$. These constructions are illustrated with the example of the

detailed exposition will be given in a forthcoming article). This derivation is
performed by combining the non-Abelian Stokes theorem with the reformulation of
the Yang-Mills theory as a perturbative deformation of a topological field
theory recently proposed by one of the authors. Within this framework, we show
that the fundamental quark is confined even if $G=SU(3)$ is broken by partial
gauge fixing into $H=U(2)$ just as $G$ is broken to $H=U(1) \times U(1)$. An
origin of the area law is related to the geometric phase of the Wilczek-Zee

greater than or equal to six. These solutions are characterized by a
non-trivial warp factor and possess a non-compact extra dimension. We study in
detail a simple model in six dimensions containing two four branes. One of each
brane's four spatial directions is compactified. The hierarchy problem is
resolved by the enormous difference between the warp factors at the positions
of the two branes, with the standard model fields living on the brane with
small warp factor. Both branes can have positive tensions. Their positions, and
the size of the compact dimension are determined in terms of the fundamental
parameters of the theory by a combination of two independent and comparable
effects---an anisotropic contribution to the stress tensor of each brane from
quantum fields living on it and a contribution to the stress tensor from a bulk
scalar field. One overall fine tuning of the parameters of the theory is
required ---that for the cosmological constant.",-0.2688849,-0.02834649,0.18618426,-0.14184986,-0.3233027,0.16438901,-0.22371498,-0.36759156,0.06297511,0.13659875,0.029739559,-0.20435515,0.17915815,-0.11671418,0.01827309,-0.0597682,-0.011970285,0.12565947,0.11852615,-0.35973528,-0.053795114,0.21438687,-0.0024442226,-0.016827796,0.029603012,-0.022629801,0.42977673,-0.06734608,0.050650343,-0.22836208,-0.13194537,0.13359387,-0.21598071,0.1290354,-0.03298701,0.09021893,-0.014840938,0.19247141,0.026511908,-0.09869331,-0.011563286,0.110033445,-0.101919144,-0.075187944,-0.43782794,-0.2580601,0.22767405,-0.2021521,0.113239326,0.083210945,-0.20041195,-0.07779064,0.093773946,-0.27890652,0.016697422,-0.19218613,0.118784234,-0.25984627,0.32817748,0.0745225,0.053712204,0.24540988,-0.15929514,0.117710784,0.34254393,0.049949504,0.26281026,-0.111887,0.034079567,0.06303483,-0.09692168,0.27232003,0.026924476,0.09305153,0.11970851,0.014592707,-0.057785124,0.19861233,-0.056189816,0.084041014,-0.14016676,0.16276027,-0.017176252,-0.17712429,0.11473305,0.16137753,0.16139878,-0.06498956,-0.05421999,-0.06262216,-0.10375176,-0.16295506,0.17852478,0.041001823,-0.03939729,-0.06524696,-0.0406138,0.051601663,-0.005799398,-0.2533821,-0.1609643,0.034454063,-0.054002777,0.14358845,-0.025441423,0.18133542,-0.028526127,0.0061443895,0.14979605,-0.23355368,0.09973684,0.048185706,0.1805618,-0.14041792,0.09422613,0.08178959,-0.09725204,0.23606828,-0.2570056,0.014016246,-0.06531616,0.060129024,-0.19604997,-0.41572985,-0.1738998,-0.15889949,-0.2149479,-0.11509041

9902003,1999,"A new family of supergravity theories in odd dimensions is presented. The
Lagrangian densities are Chern-Simons forms for the connection of a
supersymmetric extension of the anti-de Sitter algebra. The superalgebras are
the supersymmetric extensions of the AdS algebra for each dimension, thus
completing the analysis of van Holten and Van Proeyen, which was valid for N=1
and for D=2,3,4,mod 8. The Chern-Simons form of the Lagrangian ensures
invariance under the gauge supergroup by construction and, in particular, under
local supersymmetry. Thus, unlike standard supergravity, the local
supersymmetry algebra closes off-shell and without requiring auxiliary fields.
The Lagrangian is explicitly given for D=5, 7 and 11. In all cases the
dynamical field content includes the vielbein, the spin connection, N
gravitini, and some extra bosonic ``matter'' fields which vary from one
dimension to another. The superalgebras fall into three families: osp(m|N) for
D=2,3,4, mod 8, osp(N|m) for D=6,7,8, mod 8, and su(m-2,2|N) for D=5 mod 4,

9905176,1999,"We construct the three point function involving an axial vector current and
two energy-momentum tensors for four dimensional conformal field theories.
Conformal symmetry determines the form of this three point function uniquely up
to a constant factor if the necessary conservation conditions are imposed. The
gravitational axial anomaly present on a curved space background leads to a
non-zero contribution for the divergence of the axial current in this three
point function even on flat space. Using techniques related to differential
regularisation which guarantee that the energy-momentum tensor is conserved and
traceless, we calculate the anomaly in the three point function directly. In

9505018,1995,"A long-standing problem in string phenomenology has been the fact that the
string unification scale disagrees with the GUT scale obtained by extrapolating
low-energy data within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard
model (MSSM). In this paper we examine several effects that may modify the
minimal string predictions and thereby bring string-scale unification into
agreement with low-energy data. These include heavy string threshold
corrections, non-standard hypercharge normalizations, light SUSY thresholds,
intermediate gauge structure, and thresholds arising from extra matter beyond
the MSSM. We explicitly evaluate these contributions within a variety of
realistic free-fermionic string models, including the flipped SU(5), SO(6) x
SO(4), and various SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) models, and find that most of these
sources do not substantially alter the minimal string predictions. Indeed, we
find that the only way to reconcile string unification with low-energy data is
through certain types of extra matter. Remarkably, however, many of the
realistic string models contain precisely this required matter in their
low-energy spectra.",0.10247252,-0.13479857,0.08742971,-0.29934612,0.3571335,0.16328125,-0.0994543,-0.19944839,0.14349636,0.123450466,-0.30566674,0.009188991,0.031427175,0.0038774386,-0.09866465,-0.0038244575,-0.032631025,0.0668784,-0.029766083,-0.12531334,0.062299304,0.2466956,0.06756711,-0.03936289,-0.026089273,-0.11887677,0.080704406,0.07673474,-0.0054189637,-0.004164219,-0.0023690239,0.31660104,-0.088698894,0.1879234,-0.17767233,0.24458061,-0.34681818,-0.17344835,-0.009809511,0.18517537,-0.033332005,-0.23458728,-0.13133481,-0.010647945,-0.16240038,0.040972233,0.15268098,0.13540776,0.13083763,0.21372247,0.051344417,-0.18934484,-0.2492202,0.07626815,0.07844424,-0.20270674,-0.011755936,-0.3060853,0.15020649,-0.13379091,0.09323177,0.3506053,-0.09905842,0.13796115,0.028020278,0.16651288,-0.011504687,-0.023147985,-0.3114746,-0.1077409,-0.07454743,-0.1100336,0.026620083,0.15649875,0.13550036,-0.103582576,0.3453451,0.24123254,-0.2933693,0.005492879,-0.26271808,-0.043624304,-0.019260503,0.099831104,0.03347197,0.15128799,0.052436516,-0.008907087,0.08050656,0.042332903,0.014917225,0.1235336,-0.120891206,0.0046149045,0.007961873,0.28829634,-0.07073453,-0.01805304,-0.10689982,0.122585304,-0.015158229,0.17580652,-0.12592147,0.101133406,-0.082657136,0.03672419,-0.25900218,0.14450417,0.119528025,-0.04080712,0.01825288,0.0016828999,-0.023419112,-0.17846626,-0.1032439,0.12762168,0.1037225,0.12729806,-0.020500466,0.037224174,0.07368347,0.06988788,-0.107413456,-0.026103467,-0.23473749,0.066399485,0.13914034,0.21192876

interacting with a background electromagnetic field in 2+1 dimensions. Using
the method of Lund we derive a collective coordinate action for vortex defects

examine the classical dynamics of the vortices and then quantize their motion,
demonstrating that their peculiar classical motion is a result of the fact that
the quantum motion takes place in the lowest Landau level. The classical and
quantum motion in two dimensional regions with boundaries is also investigated.

9601147,1996,"It is shown that there exists a charge five monopole with octahedral symmetry
and a charge seven monopole with icosahedral symmetry. A numerical
implementation of the ADHMN construction is used to calculate the energy
density of these monopoles and surfaces of constant energy density are
displayed. The charge five and charge seven monopoles look like an octahedron
and a dodecahedron respectively. A scattering geodesic for each of these

9806236,1998,"A remarkable feature of the models with interactions exhibiting higher-spin
(HS) gauge symmetries in $d>2$ is that their most symmetric vacua require
(anti)-de Sitter (AdS) geometry rather than the flat one. In striking
parallelism to what might be expected of M theory HS gauge theories describe
infinite towers of fields of all spins and possess naturally space-time SUSY
and Chan-Paton type inner symmetries. In this paper, we analyze at the level of
the equations of motion the simplest non-trivial HS model which describes HS
gauge interactions (on the top of the usual supergravitational and
(Chern-Simons) Yang-Mills interactions) of massive spin-0 and spin-1/2 matter
fields in d=2+1 AdS space-time. The parameter of mass of the matter fields is
identified with the vev of a certain auxiliary field in the model. The matter
fields are shown to be arranged into d3 N=2 massive hypermultiplets in certain
representations of $U(n)\times U(m)$ Yang-Mills gauge groups. Discrete
symmetries of the full system are studied, and the related N=1 supersymmetric
truncations with O(n) and Sp(n) Yang-Mills symmetries are constructed. The
simplicity of the model allows us to elucidate some general properties of the
HS models. In particular, a new result, which can have interesting implications
to the higher-dimensional models, is that our model is shown to admit an
""integrating"" flow that proves existence of a non-local B\""acklund-Nicolai-type
mapping to the free system.",-0.022165336,0.025942963,0.2163707,-0.41691193,-0.063329816,0.3473358,-0.2179066,0.041530814,0.1379998,0.22853133,0.03796321,0.16099805,0.16596216,-0.0049219728,0.07069166,0.16228208,0.06419504,-0.02902028,-0.08729547,-0.05809644,-0.2408941,0.063940585,-0.041186735,0.13143826,0.102410264,0.021573894,-0.10194664,-0.16079457,0.11410064,-0.15189928,0.20378141,-0.3431576,-0.17989485,-0.03813433,0.064400986,-0.03931153,-0.051564418,0.19217852,-0.0941311,-0.21185923,-0.19159485,0.073505,0.09430319,-0.021552242,0.06383348,-0.10530304,0.20061108,-0.1258298,0.012378573,-0.05244136,0.30365264,0.11842152,-0.029992148,-0.15562418,-0.034089014,-0.13344848,-0.06362986,0.04507768,0.10450551,0.0821912,0.1414482,0.23314434,-0.0033822283,0.021143634,-0.21774,0.062299266,0.09731291,-0.12818371,-0.028264195,-0.09438886,-0.06766744,-0.121213734,0.2150551,0.15994844,0.09948954,-0.11845693,0.08689357,-0.015871242,-0.30484802,0.08023109,-0.18137908,0.02354116,-0.00037158653,-0.22366412,-0.21801339,0.1580278,-0.010233805,-0.09439642,0.22500324,-0.23887113,0.2221528,0.022098515,-0.19887073,-0.12732889,0.045714818,-0.2771464,-0.19714637,0.02814664,-0.017637372,0.00402651,-0.050934147,0.009190068,-0.15326309,0.16754586,-0.16161698,-0.032969885,-0.13418321,-0.07434896,0.07243687,-0.014238045,-0.123340055,-0.026974013,0.18587,-0.07032573,-0.078269534,-0.12388721,-0.064238414,0.18328269,-0.16322076,0.121075355,0.014472537,-0.076114625,-0.04407659,0.12271342,-0.09510052,-0.07884047,-0.14582908,0.013959721
9903228,1999,"The holographic connection between large $N$ Super Yang Mills theory and
gravity in anti deSitter space requires unfamiliar behavior of the SYM theory
in the limit that the curvature of the AdS geometry becomes small. The
paradoxical behavior includes superluminal oscillations and negative energy
density. These effects typically occur in the SYM description of events which
take place far from the boundary of AdS when the signal from the event arrives
at the boundary. The paradoxes can be resolved by assuming a very rich
collection of hidden degrees of freedom of the SYM theory which store
information but give rise to no local energy density. These degrees of freedom,
called precursors, are needed to make possible sudden apparently acausal energy
momentum flows. Such behavior would be impossible in classical field theory as
a consequence of the positivity of the energy density. However we show that
these effects are not only allowed in quantum field theory but that we can
model them in free quantum field theory.",-0.024769366,-0.096886024,-0.22819632,-0.11374697,0.10115479,0.19785254,0.06764805,-0.11687191,0.05243174,0.17636754,-0.040195867,-0.10130887,-0.070008084,0.030809596,0.225516,0.10822864,-0.09228429,-0.18026006,-0.025632225,-0.16932571,-0.15752248,0.0765252,0.20044988,-0.015279468,0.037182733,0.19214106,0.14314896,0.11468372,0.006166462,-0.039915666,-0.020895101,-0.1692366,-0.04426094,0.112057924,0.2348687,0.019787248,-0.2650698,-0.103770845,0.044184964,-0.13348603,-0.15066455,0.03759612,-0.0700804,0.075525865,-0.109856494,0.11547382,0.1175112,-0.18519296,-0.07540938,0.2629739,-0.0010752808,-0.08460839,0.085288495,0.009518903,-0.054684844,-0.09665925,-0.07368797,-0.077816874,0.18411452,0.14136729,0.067656495,0.18832125,0.03361532,0.27691126,0.21556783,0.013145138,-0.027662884,-0.010944799,-0.11103436,-0.033005327,0.11115056,0.23839948,0.18389541,-0.07426786,-0.13268867,-0.0719688,0.29310015,0.034270886,-0.0292718,0.17137203,0.066542804,-0.08528828,0.13036491,0.14894047,0.23333786,0.19636491,-0.010052279,0.16845551,-0.038549617,0.0649796,-0.15097845,0.0677057,-0.033623014,-0.041940268,-0.14120513,0.03380199,-0.21389955,-0.042389937,-0.03132903,0.10519166,0.30755252,0.21514086,0.08433319,0.2619764,0.013414223,-0.18510118,-0.3636182,-0.010333836,0.0109273195,0.06399053,0.27805638,-0.20828876,0.21176362,-0.1122942,-0.09770674,0.0529648,0.13033937,0.118021786,-0.14740017,-0.054566585,0.0016827434,0.11160213,-0.18003519,0.015942223,-0.2762271,-0.24068184,0.13050935,0.026031852

9902014,1999,"It has been shown in literature that a possible mechanism of mass generation
for gauge fields is through a topological coupling of vector and tensor fields.
After integrating over the tensor degrees of freedom, one arrives at an
effective massive theory that, although gauge invariant, is nonlocal. Here we
quantize this nonlocal resulting theory both by path integral and canonical
procedures. This system can be considered as equivalent to one with an infinite
number of time derivatives and consequently an infinite number of momenta. This
means that the use of the canonical formalism deserves some care. We show the
consistency of the formalism we use in the canonical procedure by showing that
the obtained propagators are the same as those of the (Lagrangian) path
integral approach. The problem of nonlocality appears in the obtainment of the
spectrum of the theory. This fact becomes very transparent when we list the
infinite number of commutators involving the fields and their velocities.",0.036010817,0.14066724,0.2828942,-0.046051443,-0.0710772,0.25117123,-0.10333536,-0.17181316,-0.4009247,0.45258895,0.020601949,0.083585724,0.06288555,-0.034250095,-0.1309329,0.04855922,0.18355343,-0.04459265,0.055340603,-0.19529702,-0.047807306,0.015258104,-0.03443878,-0.044809565,0.13472226,-0.09062657,-0.120098025,0.31938362,0.16223288,-0.2541361,-0.07531972,0.059499636,0.023983017,-0.126797,0.032591887,-0.12177904,-0.07179968,-0.25269008,-0.089521125,-0.082682095,-0.30101976,-0.119683854,-0.10196115,0.51263493,-0.22568671,0.023309276,0.13658476,0.32960588,0.12957767,0.14236605,-0.07713764,0.0068040565,-0.29168174,-0.038724557,-0.13337009,0.052137136,0.20378065,-0.18749444,0.41155028,0.07821101,-0.17856947,0.32207024,-0.0052961856,-0.15915766,0.12870675,0.22731343,0.022535164,0.050624564,-0.3050173,0.10058448,0.25460386,-0.057311893,0.038825423,0.03223122,0.06634341,-0.14903218,-0.15864903,0.39331967,-0.22024725,0.14614415,-0.08130638,0.24038315,0.10447044,0.06124614,0.42473954,0.059856452,0.030913599,-0.11305092,0.13593884,-0.039714962,0.10846126,0.13992521,-0.039576255,0.11992699,-0.29279664,-0.05285783,0.11141802,-0.29494578,-0.07666531,-0.0072065257,0.28686035,0.0058455467,0.48415926,-0.1217163,-0.018184803,0.43359402,-0.12771057,0.17476547,-0.16817893,-0.041160792,-0.08762507,0.09962226,-0.1297705,0.09625845,-0.26417965,-0.12937418,-0.46988913,0.10932057,-0.029633269,-0.1022991,-0.21980846,-0.061789766,-0.09786807,-0.034930244,0.0034452826,-0.07082387,-0.15731221,-0.109176144

9508032,1995,"We consider an internal space of two discrete points in the fifth dimension
of the Kaluza-Klein theory by using the formalism of noncommutative geometry
developed in a previous paper \cite{VIWA} of a spacetime supplemented by two
discrete points. With the nonvanishing internal torsion 2-form there are no
constraints implied on the vielbeins. The theory contains a pair of tensor, a
pair of vector and a pair of scalar fields. Using the generalized Cartan
structure equation we are able not only to determine uniquely the hermitian and
metric compatible connection 1-forms, but also the nonvanishing internal
torsion 2-form in terms of vielbeins. The resulting action has a rich and

9807151,1998,"We recall the special features of quantum dynamics on a light-front (in an
infinite momentum frame) in string and field theory. The reason this approach
is more effective for string than for fields is stressed: the light-front
dynamics for string is that of a true Newtonian many particle system, since a
string bit has a fixed Newtonian mass. In contrast, each particle of a field
theory has a variable Newtonian mass P^+, so the Newtonian analogy actually
requires an infinite number of species of elementary Newtonian particles. This
complication substantially weakens the value of the Newtonian analogy in
applying light-front dynamics to nonperturbative problems. Motivated by the
fact that conventional field theories can be obtained as infinite tension
limits of string theories, we propose a way to recast field theory as a
standard Newtonian system. We devise and analyze some simple quantum mechanical
systems that display the essence of the proposal, and we discuss prospects for
applying these ideas to large N_c QCD.",0.07977495,0.04579065,0.08212373,-0.20747684,0.33691174,-0.22032717,-0.09315087,-0.20614478,0.15618683,0.14514571,-0.054492876,-0.2485331,0.121980704,-0.26038063,0.2763099,0.010038592,0.2246388,-0.18665464,-0.08243735,0.3469966,-0.024952594,-0.09168607,0.11160027,0.039039053,0.22353452,0.089159854,-0.23753497,-0.219742,0.108449385,-0.10925539,0.094937794,-0.30818152,-0.27101007,-0.20136495,-0.1618395,-0.14790715,0.025384247,-0.26413748,0.28502917,0.146086,0.17705697,0.12384404,0.0138746,0.09928125,-0.22758146,-0.09765925,0.33876497,-0.041984722,-0.1698583,-0.30643153,-0.19561473,0.11471251,0.223048,0.17851199,-0.051535215,-0.25607073,0.03820326,-0.3662053,-0.086575255,0.1546248,-0.0029256642,-0.19104744,0.06273535,-0.09478429,0.18152037,-0.12494692,0.29882234,0.031671688,0.12322119,0.20101869,-0.12823752,0.20388335,-0.17898506,0.08973991,0.07514291,0.31911707,-0.17082317,0.040994123,-0.44363058,0.08912076,0.1905945,-0.40650004,-0.10396901,0.08163212,-0.30400333,-0.035440415,0.041148275,0.032219663,-0.032586724,0.14794773,-0.1678855,-0.26043364,-0.0136276055,0.039014097,0.019590728,-0.17629229,0.09271672,-0.13712087,0.026335672,0.24345389,0.13693187,0.024434239,-0.03270285,-0.32152694,0.09429963,0.3370772,-0.15377681,0.16477373,-0.097432956,-0.16336308,-0.29155812,0.12011733,-0.24742243,0.19729963,-0.04040049,0.03425006,0.13823944,0.08834551,-0.04734394,-0.030548088,0.22234213,-0.14849564,-0.07722755,0.20299724,0.14266881,-0.0025093704,0.12052605,0.13937214

9803238,1998,"We present some approaches to the perturbative analysis of the classical and
quantum gravity. First we introduce a graphical representation for a global
SO(n) tensor $(\pl)^d h_\ab$, which generally appears in the weak field
expansion around the flat space: $g_\mn=\del_\mn+h_\mn$. Making use of this
representation, we explain 1) Generating function of graphs (Feynman diagram
approach), 2) Adjacency matrix (Matrix approach), 3) Graphical classification
in terms of ""topology indices"" (Topology approach), 4) The Young tableau
(Symmetric group approach). We systematically construct the global SO(n)
invariants. How to show the independence and completeness of those invariants
is the main theme. We explain it taking simple examples of $\pl\pl h-, {and}
(\pl\pl h)^2-$ invariants in the text. The results are applied to the analysis
of the independence of general invariants and (the leading order of) the Weyl
anomalies of scalar-gravity theories in ""diverse"" dimensions (2,4,6,8,10

9509139,1995,"We apply The Batalin-Tyutin constraint formalism of converting a second class
system into a first class system for the rotational quantisation of the SU(2)
Skyrme model. We obtain the first class constraint and the Hamiltonian in the
extended phase space. The vacuum functional is constructed and evaluated in the
unitary gauge and a multiplier dependent gauge. Finally, we discuss the

9801205,1998,"It is confirmed that geodesic string junctions are necessary to describe the
gauge vectors of symmetry groups that arise in the context of IIB superstrings
compactified in the presence of nonlocal 7-branes. By examining the moduli

constant, we are able to describe explicitly and geometrically how open string
geodesics can fail to be smooth, and how geodesic string junctions then become
the relevant BPS representatives of the gauge bosons. The mechanisms that

9509001,1995,"We give the description of discretized moduli spaces (d.m.s.) $\Mcdisc$
introduced in \cite{Ch1} in terms of discrete de Rham cohomologies for moduli
spaces $\Mgn$. The generating function for intersection indices (cohomological
classes) of d.m.s. is found. Classes of highest degree coincide with the ones
for the continuum moduli space $\Mc$. To show it we use a matrix model
technique. The Kontsevich matrix model is the generating function in the
continuum case, and the matrix model with the potential $N\alpha \tr {\bigl(-
\fr 14 \L X\L X -\fr12\log (1-X)-\fr12X\bigr)}$ is the one for d.m.s. In the
latest case the effects of Deligne--Mumford reductions become relevant, and we
use the stratification procedure in order to express integrals over open spaces
$\Mdisc$ in terms of intersection indices, which are to be calculated on
compactified spaces $\Mcdisc$. We find and solve constraint equations on
partition function $\cal Z$ of our matrix model expressed in times for d.m.s.:
$t^\pm_m=\tr \fr{\d^m}{\d\l^m}\fr1{\e^\l-1}$. It appears that $\cal Z$ depends
only on even times and ${\cal Z}[t^\pm_\cdot]=C(\aa N) \e^{\cal

has been calculated in the low temperature phase, order-by-order in a low

universal form, corresponding to baby universes joined into a tree. Here the
free energy is summed to all orders, and expressed through a transcendental
algebraic equation, using which we analyze the critical phenomena that occur in
the TSMF model. There are two critical curves, at which the matter and the

9708062,1997,"We compute and analyse a variety of four-derivative gravitational terms in
the effective action of six- and four-dimensional type II string ground states
with N=4 supersymmetry. In six dimensions, we compute the relevant perturbative
corrections for the type II string compactified on K3. In four dimensions we do
analogous computations for several models with (4,0) and (2,2) supersymmetry.
Such ground states are related by heterotic-type II duality or type II-type II
U-duality. Perturbative computations in one member of a dual pair give a
non-perturbative result in the other member. In particular, the exact CP-even
R^2 coupling on the (2,2) side reproduces the tree-level term plus NS 5-brane
instanton contributions on the (4,0) side. On the other hand, the exact CP-odd
coupling yields the one-loop axionic interaction a.R\wedge R together with a
similar instanton sum. In a subset of models, the expected breaking of the
SL(2,Z)_S S-duality symmetry to a \Gamma(2)_S subgroup is observed on the
non-perturbative thresholds. Moreover, we present a duality chain that provides
evidence for the existence of heterotic N=4 models in which N=8 supersymmetry
appears at strong coupling.",-0.16077708,-0.12114045,0.23292488,-0.15340155,-0.057723656,0.20148286,-0.2471967,-0.23774476,-0.09121454,0.24762258,0.09560014,-0.001284413,0.028954402,-0.21611924,0.0394101,-0.09033767,0.16896537,-0.19931051,0.04986607,0.088492304,0.013425797,-0.054681122,0.26055664,0.15629318,0.0809173,-0.0046890527,-0.012490898,0.04164411,0.17826879,-0.09846596,-0.13512823,0.05538778,0.08198224,0.0076608453,-0.060854927,-0.049250636,-0.08552663,-0.04765117,0.00934729,-0.06711385,0.09097026,0.06434213,-0.09377768,0.09811281,0.025020659,-0.05973661,0.35035303,-0.2434251,0.010260302,-0.07487297,0.039034635,-0.004676044,-0.0647514,0.019323908,-0.1364927,0.11348857,0.096646175,-0.18964607,-0.12676778,-0.16798624,-0.08296703,0.2933112,0.33810043,0.31060496,-0.13507256,0.104314,0.057289593,-0.073680505,0.086707294,-0.013184994,-0.00516849,0.21623205,-0.016033381,0.26163694,0.106253415,-0.024827242,0.039432585,-0.10247755,-0.05273387,-0.11342877,-0.09224671,-0.063748345,0.105059296,-0.04999332,-0.17782237,-0.040211678,-0.13199337,0.21517354,-0.19779417,0.048639506,-0.19804354,0.09721457,-0.16221318,0.04322575,-0.24031262,-0.2770052,0.067774996,0.048241466,-0.047504008,-0.24474752,0.079996824,0.01956974,-0.15187564,-0.33536673,0.13447225,-0.11662294,-0.039554983,-0.042935356,-0.039451398,-0.22080535,0.11254716,-0.35637525,0.14455111,0.0788541,0.004182063,-0.0136044845,-0.0003019059,-0.072505444,0.02411852,0.29107088,0.022808827,0.029138744,-0.047116667,0.07635045,-0.017661482,0.17076606,-0.08371438,-0.2530024

9609195,1996,"Schwinger's Dynamical Casimir Effect is one of several candidate explanations
for sonoluminescence. Recently, several papers have claimed that Schwinger's
estimate of the Casimir energy involved is grossly inaccurate. In this letter,
we show that these calculations omit the crucial volume term. When the missing
term is correctly included one finds full agreement with Schwinger's result for

9708127,1997,"We analyze M theory fivebrane in order to study the moduli space of vacua of
N=1 supersymmetric $Sp(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors in four
dimensions. We show how the N=2 Higgs branch can be encoded in M theory by
studying the orientifold which plays a crucial role in our work. When all the
quark masses are the same, the surface of the M theory spacetime representing a
nontrivial ${\bf S^1}$ bundle over ${\bf R^3}$ develops $A_{N_f-1}$ type
singularities at two points where D6 branes are located. Furthermore, by
turning off the masses, two singular points on the surface collide and produce
$A_{2N_f-1}$ type singularity. The sum of the multiplicities of rational curves
on the resolved surface gives the dimension of N=2 Higgs branch which agrees
with the counting from the brane configuration picture of type IIA string
theory. By rotating M theory fivebranes we get the strongly coupled dynamics of
N=1 theory and describe the vacuum expectation values of the meson field
parameterizing Higgs branch which are in complete agreement with the field
theory results. Finally, we take the limit where the mass of adjoint chiral
multiplet goes to infinity and compare with field theory results. For massive
case, we comment on some relations with recent work which deals with N=1
duality in the context of M theory.",-0.29247165,-0.10855601,0.2160086,-0.13752371,0.08860356,0.14156723,-0.011335656,-0.15131138,0.07299826,-0.035292268,0.09765242,-0.06793274,-0.17545363,-0.10989781,-0.13026929,-0.220494,-0.019772053,0.0806985,-0.20967582,-0.27192342,0.19710451,0.069797486,0.058488086,0.085478865,0.2530836,0.25736928,0.26525375,0.032885503,-0.019954246,0.12420298,-0.21162865,0.28021294,-0.21168317,0.016270965,0.14316778,0.004242297,-0.10736283,0.17578739,0.18897134,0.10271867,0.013541117,0.0046010986,0.27099735,-0.24454263,-0.11775124,0.07723472,0.25419384,-0.07921301,-0.15948054,0.32157826,-0.13881716,-0.19671682,0.10915266,0.08819789,-0.03481019,-0.0041390583,0.08128753,-0.050903365,0.35014164,-0.20525771,0.031457752,-0.15213458,-0.2473575,-0.035876945,0.089099415,-0.021438532,-0.06868871,0.020929992,-0.09264156,-0.09933968,0.07870147,0.21307182,0.2497606,0.28029412,0.26437238,0.08583805,0.06287724,0.1730928,-0.31444073,-0.15068847,-0.33834118,0.22729896,-0.19657466,-0.2462022,0.07563819,0.011605084,-0.078395344,-0.014375657,-0.052754924,0.13394475,-0.09135282,-0.09413108,0.15593587,0.12983319,-0.15125667,0.15832536,-0.110230505,0.251565,-0.0460696,-0.08242167,-0.13033953,0.11177094,-0.003888853,-0.07499021,-0.023884896,-0.2968687,-0.22127531,0.10317754,0.22100742,-0.056158006,-0.09428495,0.19614968,0.19004726,-0.2530173,-0.19126691,-0.06655529,0.15403582,0.40043932,0.09314796,-0.03316822,-0.14723691,-0.03508115,-0.13938648,-0.25198647,-0.08572017,-0.3613417,-0.038479708,0.01719974
9707120,1997,"We discuss supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with the multiple scales in the

fundamental matter including the UV finite case of $n_{f}=2n_c$, theories
involving products of SU(n) gauge groups with bifundamental matter, and the
systems with several parameters similar to $\Lambda_{QCD}$. We argue that the
proper integrable systems are, accordingly, twisted XXX SL(2) spin chain,
$SL(p)$ magnets and degenerations of the spin Calogero system. The issue of
symmetries underlying integrable systems is addressed. Relations with the
monopole systems are specially discussed. Brane pictures behind all these

9702020,1997,"We consider the gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Models with N=1,2,3,...
in a unified framework, which is the framework of Symmetric Polynomials. By the
framework we mean an isomorphism between the space of states of the
gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model and the space of Symmetric Laurent
Polynomials. In this framework it becomes apparent that all gl(N)-invariant
Calogero-Sutherland Models are manifestations of the same entity, which is the
commuting family of Macdonald Operators. Macdonald Operators depend on two
parameters $q$ and $t$. The Hamiltonian of gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland
Model belongs to a degeneration of this family in the limit when both $q$ and
$t$ approach the N-th elementary root of unity. This is a generalization of the
well-known situation in the case of Scalar Calogero-Sutherland Model (N=1). In
the limit the commuting family of Macdonald Operators is identified with the
maximal commutative sub-algebra in the Yangian action on the space of states of
the gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model. The limits of Macdonald
Polynomials which we call gl(N)-Jack Polynomials are eigenvectors of this
sub-algebra and form Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin bases in irreducible components of
the Yangian action. The gl(N)-Jack Polynomials describe the orthogonal
eigenbasis of gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model in exactly the same way
as Jack Polynomials describe the orthogonal eigenbasis of the Scalar Model
(N=1). For each known property of Macdonald Polynomials there is a
corresponding property of gl(N)-Jack Polynomials. As a simplest application of
these properties we compute two-point Dynamical Spin-Density and Density
Correlation Functions in the gl(2)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland Model at
integer values of the coupling constant.",0.16754769,-0.13168815,0.13607809,-0.05148091,-0.04674013,-0.0717816,-0.0011075474,0.06014444,0.15274668,-0.23598212,-0.067118004,0.20313105,-0.19035304,0.23415443,0.13356526,-0.083709195,0.15444203,-0.073463336,0.09687329,0.3288614,0.0062362924,-0.20853831,-0.116959065,-0.035806485,-0.07889484,0.16522816,-0.14861166,0.060542233,-0.03586036,0.008106232,-0.103426784,-0.00847017,-0.027995478,-0.04092169,0.13774075,0.07355188,0.08670052,0.26826397,-0.01104594,-0.13309593,0.120118156,-0.015356312,-0.03190496,-0.12985454,-0.029214617,0.037938297,-0.20372999,0.03878956,-0.00029749237,-0.22610773,-0.27700582,0.21833013,0.2401161,-0.0021353588,0.13897073,0.07143921,0.067310296,0.3474511,-0.16836777,0.11360431,0.048804462,0.016228344,0.16576473,0.08004755,0.108808495,-0.068536624,-0.051665638,-0.04995036,-0.053690467,0.081412,-0.05661382,-0.23807052,-0.1569606,-0.23503125,-0.046447013,-0.112204626,0.066860184,-0.13250989,-0.04111649,0.11095936,-0.052214876,0.10222827,0.09933911,-0.20721442,-0.093856946,0.12116484,0.014729289,0.1387889,-0.14439109,-0.2874512,-0.14490941,0.07780807,0.26709437,0.21689096,0.07883695,-0.08776301,0.0018373802,0.31090805,0.0513968,-0.2045226,-0.16820066,-0.1101926,-0.07701899,-0.19839442,0.13985187,0.040194675,0.11089094,0.09241865,0.17001386,0.25095522,0.20635416,0.06030307,-0.052848913,0.029516973,0.17298521,-0.22872683,0.2610405,-0.2480684,-0.0633467,-0.12125689,-0.23719946,0.12534958,-0.3301658,-0.17607518,-0.024790842,0.05745618,0.11519486,0.09823902

apply the formalism to the free neutral Klein Gordon system, deriving the
equations of motion and conserved quantities such as the linear momentum and

9712166,1997,"We propose examples, which involve orbifolds by elements of the U-duality
group, with M-theory moduli fixed at the eleven-dimensional Planck scale. We
begin by reviewing asymmetric orbifold constructions in perturbative string
theory, which fix radial moduli at the string scale. Then we consider
non-perturbative aspects of those backgrounds (brane probes and the orbifold
action from the eleven-dimensional point of view). This leads us to consider
mutually non-perturbative group actions. Using a combination of dualities,
matrix theory, and ideas for the generalization of the perturbative orbifold

9310082,1993,"The discovery of integrable $N=2$ supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg theories
whose chiral rings are fusion rings suggests a close connection between fusion
rings, the related Landau-Ginzburg superpotentials, and $N=2$ quantum
integrability. We examine this connection by finding the natural $SO(N)_K$
analogue of the construction that produced the superpotentials with $Sp(N)_K$
and $SU(N)_K$ fusion rings as chiral rings. The chiral rings of the new
superpotentials are not directly the fusion rings of any conformal field
theory, although they are natural quotients of the tensor subring of the
$SO(N)_K$ fusion ring.
  The new superpotentials yield solvable (twisted $N=2$) topological field
theories. We obtain the integer-valued correlation functions as sums of
$SO(N)_K$ Verlinde dimensions by expressing the correlators as fusion residues.
The $SO(2n+1)_{2k+1}$ and $SO(2k+1)_{2n+1}$ related topological Landau-Ginzburg
theories are isomorphic, despite being defined via quite different

9302096,1993,"Following Hawking, it is usual to mimic the effect of collapse space-time
geometry on quantum fields in a semi-classical approximation by imposing
suitable boundary conditions at the origin of coordinates, which effectively
becomes a moving mirror. Suitable mirror trajectories induces a close analogue
to the radiance of black holes, including a flux of outgoing radiation that
appears accurately thermal. If the acceleration of the mirror eventually ceases
the complete state of the radiation field is a pure quantum state, even though
it is indistinguishable from an accurately thermal state for an arbitrarily
long period of time and in a precise sense differs little from ``pure thermal''
closely followed by ``vacuum''. Suspicions that the semiclassical calculation
of black hole radiance gives evidence for the evolution of pure into mixed
states are criticized on this basis. Possible extensions of the model to mimic
black holes more accurately (including the effects of back reaction and partial
transparency), while remaining within the realm of tractable models, are
suggested.",-0.29397848,-0.22282258,-0.23553023,0.028922588,-0.31163585,0.190878,-0.10071482,-0.19316112,-0.2721691,-0.17515373,-0.029937282,0.1603721,0.16277504,-0.13040829,-0.14297731,-0.060573615,0.20309778,-0.1468721,-0.11969541,-0.07110359,-0.06631646,0.13682815,0.08693757,-0.046243772,-0.13924983,-0.03149352,0.38456118,-0.025346875,0.3348633,-0.1476861,-0.17367612,-0.31643164,-0.023449913,-0.032060795,-0.07119125,-0.09440151,-0.025087938,-0.13170485,0.22327459,-0.20973673,-0.14704694,-0.15919955,-0.24025503,0.046336636,-0.120358855,0.23743166,0.13564017,0.2868882,0.093468435,-0.08621618,-0.13667011,0.018037308,0.049557522,0.14437848,0.0025203563,-0.07517387,0.074820206,-0.018371373,0.12021899,0.013388742,-0.05688233,0.079822406,0.065155484,-0.06485115,0.034395188,0.121017486,0.08432302,-0.050065346,-0.16104215,-0.24792282,-0.06551732,0.3087114,-0.071145475,0.017811269,-0.050924893,-0.1648493,0.034293443,0.27832866,-0.26924908,-0.08558453,0.40911907,-0.30377084,0.23340496,0.246524,0.10083473,0.1750516,0.14430366,0.13527772,0.14454797,-0.28103685,-0.14138164,-0.23675913,0.019485772,-0.0071322555,-0.14348283,-0.122032836,0.34208685,-0.0644963,-0.018704697,-0.023452003,-0.022634886,0.09736499,0.1916217,0.342631,0.1584388,-0.09709124,-0.4228059,-0.08712084,-0.1204688,-0.21886176,0.1674798,0.009421326,-0.048699766,-0.2023097,0.15790258,0.03653072,-0.41024455,0.3075598,0.2723677,0.022677965,0.25308228,0.2096674,0.057203382,-0.16757265,0.02197501,0.07072432,0.021978226,-0.05775653

9707146,1997,"We consider the 1+1 dimensional supersymmetric matrix field theory obtained
from a dimensional reduction of ten dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ super
Yang-Mills, which is a matrix model candidate for non-perturbative Type IIA
string theory. The gauge group here is U($N$), where $N$ is sent to infinity.
We adopt light-cone coordinates to parametrize the string world sheet, and
choose to work in the light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized
Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the
light-cone momentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of
1/K. We show how a double scaling limit involving the integers $K$ and $N$
implies the existence of an extra (free) parameter in the Yang-Mills theory,

9511197,1995,"Recently it was shown how to formulate the finite-element equations of motion
of a non-Abelian gauge theory, by gauging the free lattice difference
equations, and simultaneously determining the form of the gauge
transformations. In particular, the gauge-covariant field strength was
explicitly constructed, locally, in terms of a path ordered product of
exponentials (link operators). On the other hand, the Dirac and Yang-Mills
equations were nonlocal, involving sums over the entire prior lattice. Earlier,
Matsuyama had proposed a local Dirac equation constructed from just the
above-mentioned link operators. Here, we show how his scheme, which is closely
related to our earlier one, can be implemented for a non-Abelian gauge theory.
Although both Dirac and Yang-Mills equations are now local, the field strength
is not. The technique is illustrated with a direct calculation of the current
anomalies in two and four space-time dimensions. Unfortunately, unlike the
original finite-element proposal, this scheme is in general nonunitary.",0.15007797,0.0703639,-0.13748807,-0.1775055,-0.45910424,-0.26148698,-0.3667462,0.3224821,0.08219986,-0.5199512,-0.1587958,0.039373085,-0.49347413,0.15649702,0.25122184,-0.46896476,-0.8262518,0.14632042,0.06406167,0.24456778,-0.1850585,0.42118257,0.34627298,0.16811104,-0.24416271,0.22972952,-0.21436597,-0.059227005,-0.25232822,-0.10547799,0.2033769,-0.1654228,-0.5845158,0.20543726,-0.22178918,0.18109676,0.27371955,-0.17838265,-0.33358943,0.14158499,0.08717564,0.0691774,0.20179111,0.040638138,0.30416185,0.24363098,0.2064613,0.20058765,0.2527245,0.12897657,0.41166764,0.46043864,-0.35135177,0.38361982,-0.36657286,0.37418866,0.06834358,0.28323138,-0.04974562,-0.41375843,0.5315976,0.20742974,-0.5611248,0.06415506,0.29839954,-0.27730626,-0.13960183,0.14683683,-0.16677988,-0.05187553,-0.2332147,0.17083555,-0.18055794,0.09112118,0.45630682,-0.19839814,-0.06275278,-0.03566982,0.16791028,0.47163498,0.13884485,0.10843371,-0.0571462,0.4827771,-0.024331316,-0.31389838,0.06470513,-0.64756453,0.29443377,0.07149109,0.2702132,0.512018,-0.122197464,-0.35862386,0.15817687,-0.19721806,-0.08949594,0.043727152,-0.24112213,-0.20388567,-0.4561618,-0.57278454,-0.14974716,-0.04272014,0.1337867,-0.02453243,0.30043837,-0.032558896,-0.89892584,0.089599475,0.08817655,-0.3322967,0.42061839,-0.05190274,-0.08059384,-0.108098544,-0.37036252,-0.49458033,0.2910551,-0.21406937,-0.036773928,0.1093337,-0.13557133,0.13559937,0.6063811,0.0015761554,-0.587728,0.16527875

9403001,1994,"A new integrable class of quantum models representing a family of different
discrete-time or relativistic generalisations of the periodic Toda chain (TC),
including that of a recently proposed classical close to TC model [7] is
presented. All such models are shown to be obtainable from a single ancestor
model at different realisations of the underlying quantised algebra. As a
consequence the $(2\times 2)$ Lax operators and the associated quantum
$R$-matrices for these models are easily derived ensuring their quantum
integrability.

approach to quantum gauge field theory, utilizing the recent progress in the
integration theory on the moduli space of generalized connections modulo gauge

generalized connections modulo gauge transformations rather than for the
associated Schwinger distributions. We show non-triviality of our axioms by
demonstrating that they are satisfied for two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on
the plane and the cylinder. As a side result we derive a closed and analytical

9912111,1999,"Cylindrical gravitational waves of Einstein gravity are described by an
integrable system (Ernst system) whose quantization is a long standing problem.
We propose to bootstrap the quantum theory along the following lines: The
quantum theory is described in terms of matrix elements e.g. of the metric
operator between spectral-transformed multi-vielbein configurations. These
matrix elements are computed exactly as solutions of a recursive system of
functional equations, which in turn is derived from an underlying quadratic
algebra. The Poisson algebra emerging in its classical limit links the
spectral-transformed vielbein and the non-local conserved charges and can be
derived from first principles within the Ernst system. Among the noteworthy
features of the quantum theory are: (i) The issue of (non-)renormalizability is
sidestepped and (ii) there is an apparently unavoidable ``spontaneous''
breakdown of the SL(2,R) symmetry that is a remnant of the 4D diffeomorphism
invariance in the compactified dimensions.",-0.17127211,-0.3414923,0.19900754,-0.13002215,0.20079799,0.48136422,0.0029690266,-0.13490894,-0.2500512,0.10178907,0.088716045,-0.1495166,0.061179448,0.0881284,-0.15683559,-0.24532294,0.04417759,-0.12066579,-0.05706214,-0.058136802,-0.01897046,0.08383675,-0.06301643,0.12813386,0.05550435,-0.17782958,0.21169907,-0.23393099,-0.29861212,0.05382839,-0.118880734,-0.12408817,0.100876436,0.25735232,-0.43897837,-0.13578215,-0.1556275,-0.030128047,0.04735768,0.049095877,-0.28746367,-0.025592431,0.1902883,0.27804363,-0.097624004,-0.22565992,0.32382882,0.09136973,-0.23454799,-0.16595139,0.2788916,-0.083184704,-0.27923742,-0.21919239,-0.02355183,0.113527656,0.29675305,-0.27452534,0.33438852,-0.16876984,-0.0028948616,0.09081023,-0.33397356,0.514063,-0.08315498,0.035962414,0.3226002,-0.13451543,-0.29295295,0.3456154,-0.33660862,-0.03050524,0.022190638,-0.1072811,0.06011556,-0.04666709,0.1136156,-0.11770165,-0.1852503,-0.10174521,-0.19577524,0.16250521,0.017383918,-0.035112903,0.106316686,0.24881154,-0.22812802,-0.03571351,0.17782238,0.18245897,-0.011546254,0.13022491,-0.048846517,0.0056879967,0.19785048,0.021774277,0.021132104,-0.1573925,0.09232667,0.1829021,0.1040951,0.11215706,-0.20797947,0.004933268,-0.025027137,0.108447164,-0.20432067,0.054698735,-0.36342615,0.30379638,0.1279759,-0.115629114,0.14194554,-0.24673966,-0.14795162,0.14789441,-0.026222393,0.6449385,0.17776677,0.4030111,0.15641361,0.123967506,-0.12580736,-0.25228515,0.037015587,-0.059124544,-0.080433145,-0.17875777

9711012,1997,"We describe a dynamical worldsheet origin for the Lagrangian describing the
low-energy dynamics of a system of parallel D-branes. We show how matrix-valued
collective coordinate fields for the D-branes naturally arise as couplings of a
worldsheet sigma-model, and that the quantum dynamics require that these
couplings be mutually noncommutative. We show that the low-energy effective
action for the sigma-model couplings describes the propagation of an open
string in the background of the multiple D-brane configuration, in which all
string interactions between the constituent branes are integrated out and the
genus expansion is taken into account, with a matrix-valued coupling. The
effective field theory is governed by the non-abelian Born-Infeld target space
action which leads to the standard one for D-brane field theory.",-0.1804703,-0.14022893,-0.09560272,-0.2773024,-0.26752996,0.12733923,-0.12880711,0.03986978,-0.1406637,0.15203147,-0.2638589,-0.13961586,-0.24270669,-0.13661386,-0.049049146,-0.27462876,0.05284193,-0.0891605,-0.1591182,0.01643802,0.1160852,0.21706884,-0.045165196,-0.0015258789,-0.022191465,-0.10328935,-0.17300683,0.00648614,-0.015414376,-0.23694697,-0.064784825,-0.22892784,0.090262234,-0.027240641,0.1285674,0.03642133,0.1831575,0.3002553,-0.14030135,-0.15602277,-0.08364663,-0.02875049,0.036152467,0.14912769,-0.0071696043,0.02997505,0.016254753,-0.038153775,0.08048815,-0.0149154365,-0.34442127,-0.06570737,0.022985578,-0.23167682,-0.21211113,-0.12619059,0.11033191,-0.50550306,0.5411804,-0.07634981,-0.18460238,-0.13249542,0.41713804,0.1939151,-0.026730046,0.079536945,0.051048197,-0.045682076,-0.12665984,-0.20491028,-0.06847398,0.107145965,-0.33050534,0.10772453,-0.063539565,0.027192794,0.08101317,0.071190156,-0.07420744,-0.14922361,0.1720165,0.009822261,0.14316724,0.03951092,0.2032012,0.15873492,-0.058383256,-0.07932089,-0.05304484,-0.22107475,0.12538618,0.22212693,-0.19491082,0.28250203,-0.22946364,-0.2836239,0.0015245453,0.0017262995,0.1258783,0.109763406,-0.1850792,-0.014930174,0.25302896,-0.1950171,-0.0913258,-0.043552313,0.09795824,-0.1200003,0.11011386,-0.18512987,0.12913333,-0.033410754,-0.078510076,0.05913019,-0.16618817,0.33863923,-0.3677979,0.030122727,0.1979957,0.053915054,-0.082634024,-0.26095477,0.04094869,0.08803697,-0.026564807,-0.35714054,0.019898765,-0.16416726

9910236,1999,"In a previous paper we conjectured that the structure of various gauge
theories as well as M-theory on $T^8$ is encoded in a unique function $\Xi$ on
the coset $E_{10}(Z)\backslash E_{10}(R)/K$ and that this function is harmonic
with respect to the $E_{10}(R)$ invariant metric. In this paper we elaborate on
the conjecture. We discuss various mass deformations of the D-instanton
integral and their realizations in $\Xi$. We then present a conjectured
prescription for extracting partition functions of the twisted little-string
theory out of $\Xi$. We also study various effects of combinations of branes
such as D0-branes near D4-branes with 2-form flux, D-instantons near Taub-NUT
metrics, and more, in terms of harmonic functions on $E_d(R)/K$. We propose

9511031,1995,"Using the renormalization-group formalism, a sigma model of a special type-
in which the metric and the dilaton depend explicitly on one of the string
coordinates only-is investigated near two dimensions. It is seen that dilatonic
gravity coupled to N scalar fields can be expressed in this form, using a
string parametrization, and that it possesses the usual UV fixed point.
However,in this stringy parametrization of the theory the fixed point for the

9402015,1994,"A perturbative renormalization group is formulated for the study of
Hamiltonian light-front field theory near a critical Gaussian fixed point. The
only light-front renormalization group transformations found that can be
approximated by dropping irrelevant operators and using perturbation theory
near Gaussian fixed volumes, employ invariant-mass cutoffs. These cutoffs
violate covariance and cluster decomposition, and allow functions of
longitudinal momenta to appear in all relevant, marginal, and irrelevant
operators. These functions can be determined by insisting that the Hamiltonian
display a coupling constant coherence, with the number of couplings that
explicitly run with the cutoff scale being limited and all other couplings
depending on this scale only through perturbative dependence on the running
couplings. Examples are given that show how coupling coherence restores Lorentz
covariance and cluster decomposition, as recently speculated by Wilson and the

9611058,1996,"We describe the classical Schwinger model as a study of the projective
modules over the algebra of complex-valued functions on the sphere. On these
modules, classified by $\pi_2(S^2)$, we construct hermitian connections with
values in the universal differential envelope which leads us to the Schwinger
model on the sphere. The Connes-Lott program is then applied using the Hilbert
space of complexified inhomogeneous forms with its Atiyah-Kaehler structure. It
splits in two minimal left ideals of the Clifford algebra preserved by the
Dirac-Kaehler operator D=i(d-delta). The induced representation of the
universal differential envelope, in order to recover its differential
structure, is divided by the unwanted differential ideal and the obtained
quotient is the usual complexified de Rham exterior algebra over the sphere
with Clifford action on the ""spinors"" of the Hilbert space. The subsequent
steps of the Connes-Lott program allow to define a matter action, and the field
action is obtained using the Dixmier trace which reduces to the integral of the
curvature squared.",0.11146164,-0.035674557,0.14279583,-0.21153569,-0.018410064,0.2138721,-0.11904593,0.051512044,0.2404125,0.24234463,0.12028709,-0.13846627,0.026036985,-0.123107105,0.26718846,-0.15746799,-0.05502381,0.0125200525,-0.15300119,-0.078765705,0.28616434,0.17390345,0.14686589,-0.11002325,0.09145895,-0.22489491,0.18147358,0.23387218,-0.23723435,-0.14637642,0.25840336,-0.03375703,0.07943381,0.19950378,-0.07329999,-0.018524341,-0.12441005,0.013287174,-0.11307423,-0.29675433,-0.16078402,-0.067388915,0.048648983,0.19903372,-0.05032158,-0.0767197,0.07190204,0.06342201,-0.043738414,0.12148651,0.17488879,-0.3686846,0.0029587261,-0.04852584,-0.15932527,0.19968018,-0.032461315,-0.2849932,0.32622823,0.4041342,-0.19447,0.18452409,-0.21005577,-0.10091646,0.24240962,0.16524273,-0.033447288,-0.080684096,-0.22019576,0.04695207,0.21965611,0.117131144,-0.016305283,0.061395135,-0.06986089,0.046354372,0.31040937,-0.03695029,-0.29319078,0.19273032,0.15376855,0.22656965,-0.017829759,0.017060816,-0.004600629,-0.26061445,0.075301304,0.20028803,-0.000579074,0.13627252,-0.1821489,0.17092603,-0.011633053,0.028095126,-0.14238833,-0.025707707,-0.22940716,-0.12746112,-0.0021342263,0.06829032,-0.16823825,0.09076692,0.26818472,-0.21008427,-0.030488372,-0.09683235,-0.15125537,-0.04799743,0.16095859,-0.21480143,-0.21547525,-0.18412298,0.060178757,-0.26422316,-0.18505263,-0.021636816,0.08813146,0.37137392,-0.14941835,-0.27102602,0.07629143,0.1941492,0.20225465,-0.27032208,0.18680786,-0.04467586,-0.37916398,0.14410669

called Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) models. A WZNW model is a sigma model
whose classical fields are applications from a bidimensional space-time (a
Riemann surface in the euclidian case) to a Lie group, the target space. We
construct (and we compute in genus zero and one) the metric connection, called
the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard (KZB) connection, on the bundle of conformal
blocks of the WZNW model. The KZB connection may be viewed as a quantization of
Hitchin integrable systems whose configuration space is the moduli space of
principal holomorphic bundles over a Riemann surface and whose phase space is
the (holomorphic) cotangent bundle to the configuration space. For these
systems, we construct explicitly a complete familly of Hamiltonians in
involution in genus zero, one and two, with (complex) group SL(2) for the last
case. The main result is the self-duality property of the Hitchin system at
genus two, that is the invariance of the Hamiltonians with respect to the
interchange of positions and momenta in the phase space. We finally realize the

outline the main ideas/assumptions underlying (our own group's approach to)

9503055,1995,"We demonstrate that string consistency in four spacetime dimensions leads to
a spectrum of string states which satisfies the supertrace constraints
Str(M^0)=0 and Str(M^2)=\Lambda at tree level, where \Lambda is the one-loop
string cosmological constant. This result holds for a large class of string
theories, including critical heterotic strings. For strings lacking spacetime
supersymmetry, these supertrace constraints will be satisfied as a consequence
of a hidden ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the string spectrum. These results
thus severely constrain the possible supersymmetry-breaking scenarios in string
theory, and suggest a new intrinsically stringy mechanism whereby such
supertrace constraints may be satisfied without phenomenologically unacceptable
consequences.",-0.07927403,-0.124744624,0.056729533,-0.035651177,-0.07212886,0.12472817,-0.06258059,-0.07573329,0.24582702,-0.07014002,0.09107716,0.05366893,0.15261996,-0.12831153,0.06294563,0.03940791,-0.08238652,0.24272059,-0.24061418,-0.08933736,-0.15751308,0.33432236,0.08228454,0.12916529,0.11629977,-0.09683127,0.13905512,0.0054090917,0.16233818,-0.03495097,0.02853623,0.22916031,-0.11075081,0.25692087,-0.30087322,0.00487563,-0.09518737,-0.35530734,-0.08045374,-0.14024207,-0.11982153,-0.44150347,-0.17280419,-0.048724033,-0.074191354,0.069268614,0.017503798,-0.106512986,0.23848915,0.23451267,0.04840318,-0.01607026,-0.13080375,0.13458078,-0.18172169,-0.25836623,-0.16284965,-0.1252091,0.11751193,0.12835062,0.059112355,0.1274826,-0.12329692,-0.032360096,-0.09754859,0.1570476,0.042159546,-0.11119166,-0.100284725,-0.2859135,-0.05990255,0.21031936,0.031469762,0.20135358,0.38146898,0.14176655,0.20678914,0.07573211,-0.03174205,0.14661339,0.010779381,-0.09896183,-0.05428475,0.14906858,0.04858321,-0.07491397,-0.008773766,0.12826465,0.22781311,0.062387567,0.060753,-0.025890931,0.052017182,0.022404741,0.13733277,-0.19108212,-0.119150445,-0.0020422041,-0.007909985,-0.10284174,-0.09403732,0.34598655,0.011447102,-0.064789966,-0.04433509,-0.20472519,-0.17200668,0.02887217,-0.019740947,-0.21876916,-0.08669585,-0.039012164,0.31191805,-0.29282364,-0.2497471,-0.15106937,-0.3139447,0.26859307,-0.16695169,-0.22966269,0.009710163,0.2703997,-0.12013844,-0.083019644,-0.1406532,-0.028770193,0.14594314,-0.081947245

9701182,1997,"A new non-perturbative approach to quantum theory in curved spacetime and to
quantum gravity, based on a generalisation of the Wigner equation, is proposed.
Our definition for a Wigner equation differs from what have otherwise been
proposed, and does not imply any approximations. It is a completely exact
equation, fully equivalent to the Heisenberg equations of motion. The approach
makes different approximation schemes possible, e.g. it is possible to perform
a systematic calculation of the quantum effects order by order. An iterative
scheme for this is also proposed. The method is illustrated with some simple
examples and applications. A calculation of the trace of the renormalised
energy-momentum tensor is done, and the conformal anomaly is thereby related to
non-conservation of a current in d=2 dimensions and a relationship between a
vector and an axial-vector current in d=4 dimensions.
  The corresponding ``hydrodynamic equations'' governing the evolution of
macroscopic quantities are derived by taking appropriate moments. The emphasis
is put on the spin-1/2 case, but it is shown how to extend to arbitrary spins.
Gravity is treated first in the Palatini formalism, which is not very
tractable, and then more successfully in the Ashtekar formalism, where the
constraints lead to infinite order differential equations for the Wigner
functions.",-0.114176854,-0.2923881,0.15688396,0.22727951,-0.033863492,0.0711564,-0.042682905,-0.04984118,0.16899043,0.18487899,-0.3894948,0.020629376,-0.086989865,0.33278558,0.30613643,0.028135702,0.22979186,0.3186726,0.090366125,-0.039406866,0.1609366,0.06922988,0.01178503,-0.18004268,0.23705363,0.11237216,-0.25842816,0.1408295,-0.15168747,0.11968809,0.20690444,0.04275284,-0.12986082,-0.08053285,-0.04059612,-0.29508603,0.1411471,-0.10919382,0.21441862,-0.40936264,-0.33731,-0.022781625,-0.09257544,0.043210626,0.21798125,-0.38638836,-0.11635262,-0.27484035,0.25397187,0.03689812,0.1095985,-0.17525563,-0.27775955,0.4825026,0.11532765,0.4830718,0.12879762,-0.5900636,0.1368371,-0.010408904,-0.08051294,0.14362668,0.16154039,-0.04618369,-0.062112093,0.20674941,0.14434601,-0.14786401,-0.25015688,-0.23396546,0.54665446,0.013631761,0.24525358,-0.0910093,0.1325464,0.06866747,0.10962785,0.16176805,-0.4050973,-0.118270986,0.3238238,0.031784594,0.3505236,-0.24331933,0.0397487,0.060235262,0.076503016,-0.05860555,0.036184788,0.15693884,-0.02679532,0.039580733,-0.19411519,0.06749153,-0.16799062,0.2564057,-0.3530293,0.13883689,0.22387761,0.0013420731,0.044385575,0.12432477,-0.20603901,0.095294185,0.22366567,-0.16220397,0.052692413,0.08563718,0.025412321,0.0049068034,-0.086536825,0.06975454,-0.035201356,-0.13796651,-0.19572333,0.025482662,0.09964463,0.11680472,0.05085606,0.2972168,0.20578572,-0.12765428,-0.1949139,0.18739067,0.071730286,0.0019714832,-0.34051356,0.6087257

9908168,1999,"Topological properties of quantum system is directly associated with the wave
function. Based on the decomposition theory of gauge potential, a new
comprehension of topological quantum mechanics is discussed. One shows that a
topological invariant, the first Chern class, is inherent in the Schr\""odinger
system, which is only associated with the Hopf index and Brouwer degree of the

invariant under diffeomorphisms and that its Lie derivative has the form of the

transformation of the boundary metric when the radial derivative of the metric

9701180,1997,"In this article we propose a `second quantization' scheme especially suitable
to deal with non-trivial, highly symmetric phase spaces, implemented within a
more general Group Approach to Quantization, which recovers the standard
Quantum Field Theory (QFT) for ordinary relativistic linear fields. We
emphasize, among its main virtues, greater suitability in characterizing vacuum

both approaches describe the formation of a gluino condensate. With $N_f$

9805023,1998,"We apply the theory of $\alpha$-induction of sectors which we elaborated in
our previous paper to several nets of subfactors arising from conformal field
theory. The main application are conformal embeddings and orbifold inclusions
of SU(n) WZW models. For the latter, we construct the extended net of factors
by hand. Developing further some ideas of F. Xu, our treatment leads
canonically to certain fusion graphs, and in all our examples we rediscover the
graphs Di Francesco, Petkova and Zuber associated empirically to the
corresponding SU(n) modular invariants. We establish a connection between
exponents of these graphs and the appearance of characters in the
block-diagonal modular invariants, provided that the extended modular
S-matrices diagonalize the endomorphism fusion rules of the extended theories.
This is proven for many cases, and our results cover all the block-diagonal
SU(2) modular invariants, thus provide some explanation of the A-D-E

9606114,1996,"The algebra of non-commutative differential geometry (NCG) on the discrete
space $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$ previously proposed by the present author is improved
to give the consistent explanation of the generalized gauge field as the
generalized connection on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$. The nilpotency of the
generalized exterior derivative ${\mbf d}$ is easily proved. The matrix
formulation where the generalized gauge field is denoted in matrix form is
shown to have the same content with the ordinary formulation using {\mbf d},
which helps us understand the implications of the algebraic rules of NCG on
$M_4\times Z\ma{N}$. The Lagrangian of spontaneously broken gauge theory which
has the extra restriction on the coupling constant of the Higgs potential is
obtained by taking the inner product of the generalized field strength. The
covariant derivative operating on the fermion field determines the parallel
transformation on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$, which confirms that the Higgs field is
the connection on the discrete space. This implies that the Higgs particle is a
gauge particle on the same footing as the weak bosons. Thus, it is expected
that the mass relation $m\ma{H}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}m\ma{W}\sin\theta\ma{W}$
proposed by the present author holds without any correction in the same way as
the mass relation $m\ma{W}=m\ma{Z}\cos\theta\ma{W}$. The Higgs kinetic and
potential terms are regarded as the curvatures on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$.",-0.22557878,0.00024969783,-0.31760013,-0.23422283,-0.05709687,0.16480267,-0.122997925,0.55423474,0.1698755,-0.002261132,-0.0035936236,-0.054432943,-0.26844272,-0.28051066,-0.050095424,0.1892291,0.27794614,0.39627355,-0.015535511,-0.40982762,0.31549886,0.41971472,0.58381873,0.80840355,0.04052157,-0.4208811,-0.02828464,0.028849065,0.1317501,0.04173121,0.08531538,0.24856344,-0.102206916,0.3161262,-0.2965497,-0.3521972,0.13358267,-0.17642292,-0.32113352,0.026125494,0.11282614,0.001821503,-0.12153828,0.07028981,-0.38837495,-0.12015779,-0.1476914,0.062320516,0.001597954,0.4573747,0.31843722,0.15375575,0.13443308,0.18245366,0.11073314,-0.39755374,0.18482226,-0.121702194,0.19043785,-0.2586699,0.2991398,-0.10734454,-0.51716876,-0.35960567,-0.38905728,0.039636686,0.25369146,-0.1046834,0.028465152,0.017918557,0.12963757,0.19055605,-0.25748238,0.2165318,-0.10620844,-0.4593362,0.08571057,0.016734313,-0.21877266,-0.05553779,-0.12829241,-0.45205605,-0.4750548,0.45475587,0.1223581,-0.06945282,0.19190323,-0.40055764,0.27327096,0.10286796,0.5758749,0.18462442,-0.33462608,-0.330119,0.28474042,0.40107024,-0.21991345,-0.7403145,0.0144690275,0.026278242,0.0019458458,0.12499614,0.07989973,0.36910415,-0.33091736,-0.17565349,0.07359406,-0.19080117,0.032551758,-0.07397936,0.01931554,0.068828024,0.2319501,0.012658253,0.08128683,-0.119905524,0.065255284,-0.4935748,0.11095902,-0.041844517,-0.3314058,0.048647627,0.18250437,0.21441256,-0.20850863,-0.23785116,-0.3027087,0.10194291
9306153,1993,"We review recent progress in 2D gravity coupled to $d<1$ conformal matter,
based on a representation of discrete gravity in terms of random matrices. We
discuss the saddle point approximation for these models, including a class of
related $O(n)$ matrix models. For $d<1$ matter, the matrix problem can be
completely solved in many cases by the introduction of suitable orthogonal
polynomials. Alternatively, in the continuum limit the orthogonal polynomial
method can be shown to be equivalent to the construction of representations of
the canonical commutation relations in terms of differential operators. In the
case of pure gravity or discrete Ising--like matter, the sum over topologies is
reduced to the solution of non-linear differential equations (the Painlev\'e
equation in the pure gravity case) which can be shown to follow from an action
principle. In the case of pure gravity and more generally all unitary models,
the perturbation theory is not Borel summable and therefore alone does not
define a unique solution. In the non-Borel summable case, the matrix model does
not define the sum over topologies beyond perturbation theory. We also review
the computation of correlation functions directly in the continuum formulation
of matter coupled to 2D gravity, and compare with the matrix model results.
Finally, we review the relation between matrix models and topological gravity,
and as well the relation to intersection theory of the moduli space of
punctured Riemann surfaces.",0.08058639,-0.089609504,-0.008904083,-0.20523119,0.33204103,0.3251407,-0.40750164,-0.017326381,0.1442607,0.13305035,-0.13475087,-0.22921404,0.0027904906,-0.24032733,0.067855254,0.036044553,-0.010004796,0.121249564,0.19254056,0.12062331,0.173147,0.16357976,0.07122587,0.00032746978,0.24786672,-0.031937547,0.16205925,0.02918747,0.07581424,-0.26693326,0.14722429,-0.18068482,-0.04090166,0.2910591,-0.4231007,-0.16011804,-0.18190391,-0.26938376,-0.2052687,0.09396637,-0.115159586,-0.10544315,-0.096008874,-0.0033168346,-0.23844755,-0.0699991,-0.35093665,0.008460574,0.034164615,0.35216233,-0.07758876,-0.30215612,-0.18139781,0.13286968,0.105125904,-0.15928778,0.039556995,-0.03373438,0.25884324,0.10199267,-0.0037127137,0.24378633,-0.0065159565,0.09637566,0.2011098,-0.10036163,-0.12576157,-0.20777354,-0.26950926,-0.25720036,0.10106784,0.1612112,-0.12292069,0.17640229,-0.078878924,0.058895588,-0.05581695,0.2108159,-0.027615614,0.15437135,0.013477474,-0.14093286,0.012637153,0.29389018,0.13429862,0.26274142,0.054402996,0.20043659,-0.07942108,0.10657527,0.16199127,0.2457075,0.058542654,0.0037807971,0.22328229,0.043638945,-0.19002175,-0.049572423,0.084012695,-0.06464803,0.010600679,0.30162418,0.017074555,0.2081526,-0.25196552,0.17938279,-0.13710707,0.24666113,-0.011785261,-0.0074474066,0.037148472,-0.05858079,-0.013585687,-0.028576702,0.035170972,0.13531807,-0.12795228,0.027105749,-0.07107229,0.018959422,-0.061582696,0.17853403,0.18591073,-0.14392099,-0.08960731,-0.032858796,0.056737512,-0.06319599

between coupling constants in two dimensional MS scheme and a conventional

9203047,1992,"We study the effect of a Chern-Simons term in a theory with discrete gauge
group H, which in (2+1)-dimensional space time describes (non-abelian) anyons.
As in a previous paper, we emphasize the underlying algebraic structure, namely
the Hopf algebra D(H). We argue on physical grounds that the addition of a
Chern-Simons term in the action leads to a non-trivial 3-cocycle on D(H).
Accordingly, the physically inequivalent models are labelled by the elements of
the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). It depends periodically on the coefficient of

many degrees of freedom, in particular systems of non-relativistic electrons at
positive density, by expressing the quantized conserved electric charge- and
current density in terms of a bosonic antisymmetric tensorfield of a rank d--1,
where d is the dimension of space. This enables us to make concepts and tools
from gauge theory available for the purpose of analyzing electronic structure
of non-relativistic matter. We apply our bosonization identities and concepts
from gauge theory, such as Wegner -'t Hooft duality, to a variety of systems of
condensed matter physics: Landau-Fermi liquids, Hall fluids, London

9806055,1998,"The quantum properties of charged black holes (BHs) in 2D dilaton-Maxwell
gravity (spontaneously compactified from heterotic string) with $N$ dilaton
coupled scalars are studied. We first investigate 2D BHs found by McGuigan,
Nappi and Yost. Kaluza-Klein reduction of 3D gravity with minimal scalars leads
also to 2D dilaton-Maxwell gravity with dilaton coupled scalars and the
rotating BH solution found by Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) which can
be also described by 2D charged dilatonic BH. Evaluating the one-loop effective
action for dilaton coupled scalars in large $N$ (and s-wave approximation for
BTZ case), we show that quantum-corrected BHs may evaporate or else
anti-evaporate similarly to 4D Nariai BH as is observed by Bousso and Hawking.
Higher modes may cause the disintegration of BH in accordance with recent

9905221,1999,"We introduce and study one parameter family of integrable quantum field
theories. This family has a Lagrangian description in terms of massive Thirring
fermions $\psi,\psi^{\dagger}$ and charged bosons $\chi,\bar{\chi}$ of complex
sinh-Gordon model coupled with $BC_n$ affine Toda theory. Perturbative
calculations, analysis of the factorized scattering theory and the Bethe ansatz
technique are applied to show that under duality transformation, which relates
weak and strong coupling regimes of the theory the fermions
$\psi,\psi^{\dagger}$ transform to bosons and $\chi,\bar{\chi}$ and vive versa.
The scattering amplitudes of neutral particles in this theory coincide exactly
with S-matrix of particles in pure $BC_n$

9605084,1996,"In order to construct a massive tensor theory with a smooth massless limit,
we apply two kinds of gauge-fixing procedures, Nakanishi's one and the BRS one,
to two models of massive tensor field. The first is of the Fierz-Pauli (FP)

9407097,1994,"We discuss the relations between (topological) quantum field theories in 4
dimensions and the theory of 2-knots (embedded 2-spheres in a 4-manifold). The
so-called BF theories allow the construction of quantum operators whose trace
can be considered as the higher-dimensional generalization of Wilson lines for
knots in 3-dimensions. First-order perturbative calculations lead to higher
dimensional linking numbers, and it is possible to establish a heuristic
relation between BF theories and Alexander invariants. Functional

9902191,1999,"The theta dependence of the vacuum energy in large N Yang-Mills theory has
been studied some time ago by Witten using a duality of large N gauge theories
with string theory compactified on a certain space-time. We show that within
the field theory context vacuum fluctuations of the topological charge give
rise to the vacuum energy consistent with the string theory computation.
Furthermore, we calculate 1/N suppressed corrections to the string theory
result. The reconciliation of the string and field theory approaches is based
on the fact that the gauge theory instantons carry zerobrane charge in the
corresponding D-brane construction of Yang-Mills theory. Given the formula for
the vacuum energy we study certain aspects of stability of the false vacua of
the model for different realizations of the initial conditions. The vacuum
structure appears to be different depending on whether N is infinite or,
alternatively, large but finite.",-0.46538734,-0.2354352,0.079171166,-0.058489382,0.086006775,0.20712379,0.07459691,0.2572726,0.11186904,-0.18775776,0.017349653,0.039340533,0.0029521137,0.17182904,-0.19375008,0.08206451,0.015821524,-0.81174207,0.26572773,0.26060224,0.24935034,-0.35405052,-0.13960308,0.15821213,-0.10027054,0.3203463,-0.25499278,0.48132,0.053310342,-0.075886995,0.113432154,-0.122138225,-0.4304482,0.14847651,0.1244863,0.2225558,-0.00819537,0.19587603,0.038732722,0.23235543,0.11459732,0.21160364,-0.33846506,-0.02180548,0.2043243,0.4905951,0.12911987,0.041917227,0.1465248,0.32950467,0.034040883,0.084713385,0.46848553,0.17568241,0.11677705,0.25647685,-0.44749928,0.5310941,-0.21325567,0.39353848,0.21663779,-0.124658525,-0.08453867,-0.3872653,0.124605104,-0.18168204,0.020851368,0.29406494,-0.38904175,0.3001414,0.22727403,-0.42596322,-0.21242487,0.3592978,-0.19458438,-0.13507234,-0.085109845,-0.09779024,-0.15424602,-0.062273003,-0.23181263,-0.047260955,0.20937663,-0.17641431,-0.43845278,0.26617718,0.06983347,0.35925066,-0.4130576,0.14821078,-0.002125878,-0.17281623,0.28271705,0.05408039,-0.36672884,-0.090528116,-0.053873286,0.040315673,0.30289033,-0.07341999,-0.092665076,-0.014598757,-0.28418812,-0.102647394,-0.09571609,0.054520227,-0.3124831,0.34915203,0.26174018,0.20302474,0.3089062,0.24604115,-0.3078962,-0.045118243,-0.008724779,-0.02275794,0.14846781,-0.070482045,0.65747994,0.005769469,-0.073870815,0.06696583,-0.12204465,-0.05706527,-0.02511017,-0.12607655,-0.27150175,-0.02551043

9803116,1998,"This review considers the properties of classical solutions to supergravity
theories with partially unbroken supersymmetry. These solutions saturate
Bogomol'ny-Prasad-Sommerfield bounds on their energy densities and are the
carriers of the $p$-form charges that appear in the supersymmetry algebra. The
simplest such solutions have the character of $(p+1)$-dimensional
Poincar\'e-invariant hyperplanes in spacetime, i.e. $p$-branes. Topics covered
include the relations between mass densities, charge densities and the
preservation of unbroken supersymmetry; interpolating-soliton structure;
diagonal and vertical Kaluza-Klein reduction families; multiple-charge
solutions and the four D=11 elements; duality-symmetry multiplets; charge

gauge theory with two sorts of FI terms, electric and magnetic ones, within
manifestly supersymmetric formulations via the Mezincescu and harmonic-analytic

the N=2 Maxwell effective holomorphic action with standard electric $FI$ term
and demonstrate that in such a system off-shell N=2 supersymmetry is inevitably
realized in an unusual Goldstone mode corresponding to the {\it partial}
spontaneous breaking down to N=1. On shell, the standard total breaking occurs.
In a system with the two sorts of FI terms, off-shell N=2 supersymmetry is
realized in the partial breaking mode both in the electric and magnetic
representations. This regime is retained on shell due to the Antoniadis-
Partouche-Taylor mechanism. We show that the off-shell algebra of N=2
supersymmetry in the partial breaking realization is modified on gauge-variant
objects like potentials and prepotentials. The closure of spinor charges

cosmology has uncovered the existence of an entire class of (spatatially)
homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic space-times, analogous to the class

cosmological constant but non-vanishing dilaton and antisymmetric field are
explicitly found for all types. This is a new class of solutions, whose
isotropy limits reproduce all known and, further, all possible FRW-type of

here proven to be valid even in cases of known spectrum but non-compact
manifold (very important in Physics)--- zeta-function regularisation techniques
are shown to be extremely efficient. Dirac like operators and harmonic
oscillators are investigated in detail, in any number of space dimensions. They
yield a non-zero anomaly which, on the other hand, can always be expressed by
means of a simple analytical formula. These results are used in several
physical examples, where the determinant of a product of differential operators
is not equal to the product of the corresponding functional determinants. The

space, we are naturally led to a connection for the infinite dimensional vector

9311052,1993,"We describe the Hamiltonian reduction of the coajoint Kac-Moody orbits to the
Virasoro coajoint orbits explicitly in terms of the Lagrangian approach for the
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten theory. While a relation of the coajoint Virasoro
orbit $Diff \; S^1 /SL(2,R)$ to the Liouville theory has been already studied
we analyse the role of special coajoint Virasoro orbits $Diff \;
S^1/\tilde{T}_{\pm ,n}$ corresponding to stabilizers generated by the vector
fields with double zeros. The orbits with stabilizers with single zeros do not
appear in the model. We find an interpretation of zeros $x_i$ of the vector
field of stabilizer $\tilde{T}_{\pm ,n}$ and additional parameters $q_i$, $i =
1,...,n$, in terms of quantum mechanics for $n$ point particles on the circle.
We argue that the special orbits are generated by insertions of ""wrong sign""
Liouville exponential into the path integral. The additional parmeters $q_i$
are naturally interpreted as accessory parameters for the uniformization map.
Summing up the contributions of the special Virasoro orbits we get the
integrable sinh-Gordon type theory.",0.14790484,0.17543757,-0.071273744,0.11171344,0.13820113,0.11798912,-0.31352475,0.032122906,-0.101528704,0.29710367,-0.27146778,-0.370888,0.31839776,0.12966171,0.36625457,-0.3451939,0.09035164,-0.08795507,-0.36921424,0.039839182,0.040005147,-0.090536386,-0.27484643,-0.16447873,0.07515019,-0.41630578,-0.40964383,0.33739343,0.044044048,0.31630898,0.092667565,0.14539105,0.005979048,0.35679564,0.03025135,0.008085743,-0.3928167,-0.12816474,0.19380558,-0.065534525,0.034268975,0.029827163,0.34385723,0.26313537,-0.083685994,0.10654761,0.04270783,0.12447035,-0.15951993,-0.020082563,-0.29255828,-0.06473696,0.31748554,-0.17206006,-0.07719686,-0.34069166,0.11261305,-0.4936281,0.41766396,0.1455034,0.32103664,0.13007903,0.15296246,0.21863456,0.33972716,0.2496074,-0.13981177,-0.2054497,-0.2386349,-0.09607628,-0.05515836,-0.31993234,0.1735057,-0.579409,0.2950802,-0.015427427,0.39870048,0.25007537,-0.15798116,-0.10886083,-0.06933746,-0.036242142,-0.25883037,0.38532957,0.054180406,0.270859,-0.12340969,0.5373062,0.11047585,0.14836468,-0.41487122,0.014128245,-0.08011967,0.15067665,-0.2390053,-0.051909395,0.18852398,-0.49751103,0.26401603,-0.030446,-0.09340101,0.1962227,0.101373844,-0.15072861,-0.030165523,0.37540928,-0.08598077,0.19398554,-0.08615928,0.25175616,-0.044625618,0.09950346,-0.009986281,0.113591775,0.048273847,0.026155671,-0.038013987,0.47515085,0.14041196,0.09931487,-0.48834684,-0.10882234,-0.22040755,-0.17949256,-0.33951753,-0.066978015,0.1295189,-0.4666334

9907203,1999,"We consider anomaly cancelations in Type IIB orientifolds on T^4/Z_N with
quantized NS-NS sector background B-flux. For a rank b B-flux on T^4 (b is
always even) and when N is even, the cancelation requires a 2^{b/2}
multiplicity of states in the 59-open string sector. We identify the twisted
sector R-R scalars and tensor multiplets which are involved in the
Green-Schwarz mechanism. We give more details of the construction of these
models and argue that consistency with the 2^{b/2} multiplicity of 59-sector

9210029,1992,"The relationship between the nonlinear Schrodinger hierarchy and the
parafermion and SL(2,R)/U(1) coset models, analogous to the relationship
between the KdV hierarchy and the minimal models, is explained. To do this I
first present an in depth study of a series of integrable hierarchies related
to NLS, and write down an action from which any of these hierarchies, and the
associated second Poisson bracket structures, can be obtained. In quantizing
the free part of this action we find many features in common with the bosonized

9412199,1994,"In these lectures, we study and compare two different formulations of
$SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. The first,
conventional, formulation employs the affine symmetry of the model; in this
approach correlation functions are derived from the so-called
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The second formulation is based on an
entirely different algebraic structure, the so-called Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. In
this approach, the Hilbert space of the theory is obtained by repeated
application of modes of the so-called spinon field, which has $SU(2)$ spin
$j=\thalf$ and obeys fractional (semionic) statistics. We show how this new
formulation, which can be generalized to many other rational conformal field
theories, can be used to compute correlation functions and to obtain new
expressions for the Virasoro and affine characters in the theory. [Lectures

9810223,1998,"As in two and four dimensions, supersymmetric conformal field theories in
three dimensions can have exactly marginal operators. These are illustrated in
a number of examples with N=4 and N=2 supersymmetry. The N=2 theory of three
chiral multiplets X,Y,Z and superpotential W=XYZ has an exactly marginal
operator; N=2 U(1) with one electron, which is mirror to this theory, has one
also. Many N=4 fixed points with superpotentials W \sim Phi Q_i \tilde Q^i have
exactly marginal deformations consisting of a combination of Phi^2 and (Q_i
\tilde Q^i)^2. However, N=4 U(1) with one electron does not; in fact the
operator Phi^2 is marginally irrelevant. The situation in non-abelian theories
is similar. The relation of the marginal operators to brane rotations is
briefly discussed; this is particularly simple for self-dual examples where the
precise form of the marginal operator may be guessed using mirror symmetry.",-0.13743258,-0.25263488,0.173768,-0.621347,-0.18451191,0.22636949,0.03262721,0.038770292,-0.14880992,-0.049913436,-0.28585434,0.111442044,-0.31377253,-0.38836282,0.17592521,0.4597712,-0.27020144,0.16890925,0.018816862,-0.20634617,0.3053684,0.5182544,0.27589285,-0.06370234,-0.0027106553,0.101091996,-0.09455484,-0.46052286,0.0403087,-0.16416726,0.05230673,-0.19454686,-0.007960722,0.26662433,0.2121163,-0.006589666,-0.05559326,0.07714382,-0.21794176,-0.15545832,0.11189779,-0.14041974,0.030340329,0.034160852,0.20024304,0.25343594,-0.14848429,-0.20132254,0.043018125,0.23723316,-0.008904189,0.2727154,-0.008132435,-0.26604527,0.07457085,-0.2616894,-0.06994527,0.121133566,0.071057454,-0.21675566,-0.098557815,0.028812857,0.1847891,0.14166686,0.14454827,-0.29270703,-0.11955215,0.20764847,-0.017530326,-0.4368863,-0.24252495,0.5020741,-0.0014427751,0.014271025,-0.05205395,-0.082554534,0.19955611,-0.1296153,0.30893847,0.07224065,0.0753878,-0.11330526,0.10507143,0.4182173,0.20385483,0.09249993,-0.14174898,0.12818518,-0.30378598,0.13700907,0.088625215,0.09988813,-0.18455146,0.015775576,0.06452279,0.14822155,0.07982133,0.34848478,-0.18909709,0.07643589,-0.0043587834,-0.035248727,0.021568784,-0.31201023,-0.060588226,-0.3997817,0.20966014,-0.08519131,0.19274789,-0.06630115,-0.38659275,-0.37119186,0.23456427,-0.41224903,0.05958198,-0.071824655,0.06554208,0.12797281,-0.093770474,0.3179732,-0.04141467,0.023202613,-0.011459067,0.02726958,0.44419855,-0.009054281,-0.24146006,0.23852152
9302101,1993,"The quantum theory of the spherically symmetric gravity in 3+1 dimensions is
investigated. The functional measures are explicitly evaluated and the physical
state conditions are derived by using the technique developed in two
dimensional quantum gravity. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM
formalism come out. If $\kappa_s > 0 $, where $\kappa_s =(N-27)/12\pi $ and $N$
is the number of matter fields, a singularity appears, while for $\kappa_s <0$
the singularity disappears. The quantum dynamics of black hole seems to be

9503091,1995,"Considering bilayer systems as extensions of the planar ones by an internal
space of two discrete points, we use the ideas of Noncommutative Geometry to
construct the gauge theories for these systems. After integrating over the
discrete space we find an effective $2+1$ action involving an extra complex
scalar field, which can be interpreted as arising from the tunneling between
the layers. The gauge fields are found in different phases corresponding to the
different correlations due to the Coulomb interaction between the layers. In a
particular phase, when the radial part of the complex scalar field is a

Schrodinger model is equivalent to an Abelian gauge field theory of continuum

meaning of coordinates in tangent plane to the spin phase space, while the U(1)

the infinite hierarchy of integrable gauge theories and corresponding magnetic

9505093,1995,"In this paper, we review various properties of the supersymmetric Two Boson
(sTB) system. We discuss the equation and its nonstandard Lax representation.
We construct the local conserved charges as well as the Hamiltoniam structures
of the system. We show how this system leads to various other known
supersymmetric integrable models under appropriate field redefinition. We
discuss the sTB and the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\""odinger (sNLS) equations
as constrained, nonstandard supersymmetric Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (sKP) systems
and point out that the nonstandard sKP systems naturally unify all the KP and
mKP flows while leading to a new integrable supersymmetrization of the KP
equation. We construct the nonlocal conserved charges associated with the sTB

$SU(2)$ QCD. We present the complete construction of the multi-instanton in

reduced to the algebraic equations. Using this result, we calculate the
two-instanton contribution ${\cal F}_2$ to the prepotential ${\cal F}$ for the

9304029,1993,"A class of two-dimensional topological conformal field theories (TCFTs) is
studied within the framework of gauged WZW models in order to gain some
insights on the global geometrical nature of TCFTs. The BRST quantizations of
topological G/H gauged WZW models (the twisted versions of SUSY gauged WZW
models) are given under fixed back-ground gauge fields. The BRST-cohomology of
the system is investigated and the correlation functions among these physical
observables are considered under the instanton back-grounds. As a consequence,
two-dimensional BF gauge theoretical aspects of TCFTs are revealed. Especially
it is shown that two correlation functions under the different instanton
back-grounds can change to each other. This process of transmutation is
described by the spectral flow. The flow is formulated as a ""singular"" gauge
transformation which creates an appropriate back-ground charge on the physical
vacuum of the system. The field identification problem of the system is also
discussed from the above point of view.",-0.013878018,-0.44595218,-0.072583094,0.14874643,-0.16416405,0.21334426,0.006756842,-0.16306442,-0.06858149,0.006753862,0.024020746,0.30824745,-0.09830963,0.14615902,-0.12680203,0.24828887,-0.10234572,0.11970595,0.24680772,-0.12377991,-0.25836068,0.2754975,0.11312787,-0.09877847,0.030970544,-0.2288553,0.29600978,-0.33180127,-0.08455613,-0.22336558,-0.20939183,0.47667813,-0.045787796,-0.22981109,-0.38314155,0.33365598,0.019501101,-0.24412858,0.40984783,-0.047541663,-0.28043523,-0.103608415,-0.21269304,-0.08676572,-0.13908312,-0.32353288,0.017405912,-0.26174462,0.15726766,0.06380148,-0.12928045,-0.14719057,-0.19373395,0.17217198,0.010270923,-0.1475601,0.26189262,-0.2717163,-0.14430577,-0.41375482,-0.030049711,0.41808742,0.030861242,0.10066917,-0.1711028,-0.0687773,-0.16372693,-0.22234938,-0.11370005,0.1975711,0.19508955,0.2684228,-0.049382716,0.54185355,0.038686074,0.22123526,0.12674701,-0.12414736,0.26662946,-0.059144318,0.11196104,-0.12892842,0.084337614,-0.21088402,0.07701944,0.026360571,-0.12975667,-0.2015942,0.0051018978,-0.013504397,-0.115699254,-0.062386066,0.36205798,-0.13842463,0.04956089,0.32638884,-0.042990252,0.2432591,0.040678643,0.06093636,-0.20939377,0.048726425,-0.07622461,0.004928272,-0.048198782,-0.056542665,0.09361228,0.11392906,-0.23622036,0.07545297,0.14023305,-0.09675913,-0.015573174,0.1211407,-0.086661816,0.06772433,-0.055969767,0.3757484,0.12780857,-0.05418288,0.03196773,0.20246825,0.08187607,0.26330584,0.04310435,0.013758816,0.3210299,-0.16924751

the guiding principle `first lift to G and then project to G/H'. It is then
shown that this principle gives a simple procedure to obtain the inequivalent
quantizations (superselection sectors) along with the holonomy factor (induced
gauge field) found earlier by algebraic approaches. We also prove that the

9409013,1994,"The stability of the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole
solution is investigated in the context of a theory with massive charged vector
mesons. By exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem, the linear
perturbations about the Reissner-Nordstrom solution can be decomposed into
modes of definite angular momentum $J$. For each value of $J$, unstable modes
appear if the horizon radius is less than a critical value that depends on the
vector meson gyromagnetic ratio $g$ and the monopole magnetic charge $q/e$. It
is shown that such a critical radius exists (except in the anomalous case
$q={1\over 2}$ with $0 \le g \le 2$), provided only that the vector meson mass
is not too close to the Planck mass. The value of the critical radius is
determined numerically for a number of values of $J$. The instabilities found

9608011,1996,"The classical Yang--Mills equations are analyzed within the geometrical
framework of an effective gravity theory. Exact analytical solutions are
derived for the cylindrically symmetric configurations of the coupled gauge and
isoscalar fields. It turns out that there is an infinite family of solutions
parametrized by two real parameters, one of which determines the asymptotic
behavior of fields near the symmetry axis and in infinity, while the second
locates the singularity. These configurations have a simple pole at a finite
value of the radial coordinate, and physically they represent ``thick
string''-like objects which possess the confinement properties. It is
demonstrated that the particles with gauge charge cannot move classically and
quantum mechanically out of the interior region. Such an objects are thus
direct analogues of the ``black string'' gravitational configurations reported
recently in the literature.",-0.010023031,0.16679862,0.044565417,0.21614966,0.16469476,0.06009379,-0.11008048,-0.1302937,0.18658556,0.2331922,0.11875574,-0.20683639,0.11627132,0.04000728,0.18969092,-0.33561742,-0.062031202,0.010039203,0.25022843,0.19889009,-0.11931661,0.16242972,-0.08768599,0.12413286,0.04635188,0.021586642,0.31417057,-0.026749298,0.011429956,-0.17132294,0.020901974,-0.117218375,-0.059154227,-0.07525326,0.0004899651,0.1285101,-0.012296766,-0.4434771,0.19268581,-0.098840594,0.015017688,-0.19628799,-0.06994914,-0.09982885,-0.13328204,0.13637398,-0.04975804,0.11255842,-0.08979075,0.23362845,0.3477938,-0.09685968,0.03151846,0.3264742,0.08538216,0.3507268,-0.11498309,0.029163092,-0.014714122,0.006703716,-0.123383105,-0.15204829,-0.26031187,-0.18872459,0.17488149,0.07865976,0.25757104,0.19885954,-0.03209266,-0.15013865,-0.1172475,0.37451726,-0.1433453,0.11881131,-0.18685907,-0.072475605,0.28390598,0.16692066,-0.18956125,-0.19665028,0.20560224,-0.07882185,0.12364878,0.2946598,-0.1479839,0.04566689,-0.0059791133,-0.035978142,0.086353496,0.10606843,-0.24442211,-0.3414022,-0.074850224,0.05313966,-0.24782217,-0.23764673,-0.12948711,-0.17626113,0.18340355,0.2901271,-0.21905185,-0.13238052,0.13555267,-0.13474491,0.08990037,0.47162995,0.1167566,0.15624788,-0.32598478,-0.17852098,-0.2953452,-0.14552552,-0.1721786,0.0443966,-0.15724328,0.4152605,0.09207428,-0.0042218864,0.17357612,0.12689963,-0.23805416,0.11982775,0.18830964,0.0665912,0.33706152,0.016711675,-0.21817213,-0.11113268

9908023,1999,"We show how to construct chiral tachyon-free perturbative orientifold models,
where supersymmetry is broken at the string scale on a collection of branes
while, to lowest order, the bulk and the other branes are supersymmetric. In
higher orders, supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the remaining sectors, but
is suppressed by the size of the transverse space or by the distance from the
brane where supersymmetry breaking primarily occurred. This setting is of
interest for orbifold models with discrete torsion, and is of direct relevance

9608038,1996,"Some mathematical inconsistencies in the conventional form of Maxwell's
equations extended by Lorentz for a single charge system are discussed. To
surmount these in framework of Maxwellian theory, a novel convection
displacement current is considered as additional and complementary to the
famous Maxwell displacement current. It is shown that this form of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations is similar to that proposed by Hertz for
electrodynamics of bodies in motion. Original Maxwell's equations can be
considered as a valid approximation for a continuous and closed (or going to
infinity) conduction current. It is also proved that our novel form of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations is relativistically invariant. In particular, a
relativistically invariant gauge for quasistatic fields has been found to
replace the non-invariant Coulomb gauge. The new gauge condition contains the
famous relationship between electric and magnetic potentials for one uniformly
moving charge that is usually attributed to the Lorentz transformations.
Thus, for the first time, using the convection displacement current, a physical
interpretation is given to the relationship between the components of the
four-vector of quasistatic potentials. A rigorous application of the new gauge
transformation with the Lorentz gauge transforms the basic field equations into
an independent pair of differential equations responsible for longitudinal and

9906218,1999,"Non-singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are constructed
using the exact conformal field theories corresponding to SO(2,1)/SO(1,1) and
SO(2,2)/SO(2,1). All semi-classical curvature singularities are canceled in the
exact theories for both of these cosets, but some new quantum curvature
singularities emerge. However, considering different patches of the global
manifolds, allows the construction of non-singular spacetimes with cosmological
interpretation. In both two and three dimensions, we construct non-singular
oscillating cosmologies, non-singular expanding and inflationary cosmologies
including a de Sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature as
well as non-singular contracting and deflationary cosmologies. We analyse these
cosmologies in detail with respect to the behaviour of the scale factors, the
scalar curvature and the string-coupling. The sign of the scalar curvature is
changed by the quantum corrections in oscillating cosmologies and evolves with
time in the non-oscillating cases. Similarities between the two and three
dimensional cases suggest a general picture for higher dimensional coset
cosmologies: Anisotropy seems to be a generic unavoidable feature, cosmological
singularities are generically avoided and it is possible to construct
non-singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencing
inflation while the others experience deflation.",0.07980233,0.37267196,0.00595513,-0.15827501,0.090657204,0.12911375,-0.2071969,0.037709773,0.21127695,-0.055224195,-0.38509586,-0.014052317,0.09726927,-0.07182764,0.09269396,-0.2897776,-0.48701924,0.26522616,0.06451281,-0.025489695,0.010121867,0.26342657,0.113349296,0.15302771,0.21627049,0.07701574,0.027531281,0.22892742,-0.39655203,0.008636177,0.1403465,-0.21125093,-0.07677722,-0.08239521,-0.0013892651,-0.14671005,-0.20382269,-0.04419321,0.091286235,0.15169446,-0.03267944,-0.07221986,0.009234438,0.059157435,-0.20277843,0.14265434,0.14005776,-0.2896824,-0.3346122,0.15079752,-0.1390216,-0.08261706,-0.17665902,0.11051226,-0.11485338,-0.12908515,-0.14567994,-0.030502945,0.0038272142,-0.19037862,0.20929699,0.24560373,-0.10238844,0.2857765,0.10966389,-0.045050234,0.22689766,0.1991768,0.13756198,-0.12415478,0.18233082,0.1265272,-0.022473365,0.021418117,0.46121693,-0.08463205,-0.016974986,-0.064373046,0.23417306,0.15813243,-0.25790915,0.10645865,0.24146414,-0.07572177,0.3696493,0.0072565973,0.17620447,0.035609618,0.109705865,-0.023554958,-0.040844735,0.118660174,-0.07846117,0.13836588,0.06985073,-0.082965955,-0.2064796,0.18122521,-0.07682604,-0.033200793,-0.11017316,0.13323686,-0.11814232,-0.1462999,-0.008844465,0.15924509,-0.023590565,0.07180804,-0.10926205,0.007263005,-0.014692575,0.1279218,0.05886461,-0.14274624,-0.10689871,0.023563504,-0.0050701443,-0.07308072,-0.023685083,-0.14544354,-0.069167964,-0.175318,0.10951165,0.041285004,-0.20755439,-0.020230874,-0.040717117,-0.28175405

UV/IR relations. It is shown that certain singular structures on the quotient
boundary ${\bf S}^{d}/\Gamma$ can affect the underlying physical spectrum. In
particular, the conformal dimension of the most relevant operators in the
boundary CFT can increase as $\Gamma$ becomes ``large''. This phenomenon also
has a natural explanation in terms of the bulk supergravity theory. The scalar
two-point function is computed using this quotient version of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, which agrees with the expected result derived from conformal
invariance of the boundary theory.",-0.21722895,0.2392371,0.12309479,0.057939872,-0.2479585,-0.003938645,0.05743204,-0.22662194,-0.18508354,0.2424973,-0.17126276,-0.0923983,0.10951747,-0.13916285,0.009598434,-0.20695409,-0.048515305,0.16505891,-0.017071351,-0.19322824,-0.15272447,0.15480007,-0.1498908,0.1205892,0.05661376,0.18318576,-0.05236943,0.115523785,0.021202786,0.19457968,0.29792577,0.13104963,0.09276794,0.06815445,0.3214013,-0.4403383,-0.1896792,0.18644607,-0.13029194,0.05756747,-0.10428978,-0.04179482,0.2550884,0.26653093,-0.06454487,-0.12527716,0.12043567,-0.006166041,0.3214906,-0.20446484,0.018691614,-0.0110465735,0.07557079,-0.1800339,-0.3094817,-0.2102885,-0.22117966,-0.049823582,0.07485658,0.12937969,0.26906157,-0.09316651,-0.20489317,0.054906495,0.11763273,0.20336854,0.06049518,0.10139416,0.0288213,-0.19075847,0.032127783,0.08122429,0.29117948,-0.12973714,0.10970996,-0.084319554,-0.11426884,0.072335124,0.018359289,-0.044737644,0.10249308,0.14248773,-0.16161239,0.16218162,0.2657766,0.054145455,0.1174054,0.044870406,0.07949081,0.015282787,-0.22929284,-0.04327295,-0.22550976,0.14347354,-0.00091904774,-0.06447107,0.101450354,-0.31606224,0.14696375,-0.18661994,-0.08721429,-0.10385503,-0.16921915,-0.0030693412,0.07190344,-0.2145408,-0.16880903,-0.05764921,-0.1383883,0.12969086,0.24027155,-0.072747804,0.0205549,-0.09478334,-0.09209177,-0.1436771,-0.074524626,0.26492208,-0.16365388,-0.14505695,0.14850366,-0.12535629,-0.09976269,-0.19880664,-0.06522018,-0.097174905,-0.26734498,-0.22191526

related to Dedekind zeta values, with coprime integers $a$ and $b$ giving $a/b

whose invariant trace field $K$ has a single complex place, discriminant $D$,
degree $n$, and Dedekind zeta value $\zeta_K(2)$. The largest numerator of the
998 invariants of Hodgson-Weeks manifolds is, astoundingly,
$a=2^4\times23\times37\times691 =9,408,656$; the largest denominator is merely
b=9. We also study the rational invariant a/b for single-complex-place cusped
manifolds, complementary to knots and links, both within and beyond the
Hildebrand-Weeks census. Within the censi, we identify 152 distinct Dedekind
zetas rationally related to volumes. Moreover, 91 census manifolds have volumes
reducible to pairs of these zeta values. Motivated by studies of Feynman
diagrams, we find a 10-component 24-crossing link in the case n=2 and D=-20. It
is one of 5 alternating platonic links, the other 4 being quartic. For 8 of 10
quadratic fields distinguished by rational relations between Dedekind zeta
values and volumes of Feynman orthoschemes, we find corresponding links.
Feynman links with D=-39 and D=-84 are missing; we expect them to be as
beautiful as the 8 drawn here. Dedekind-zeta invariants are obtained for knots
from Feynman diagrams with up to 11 loops. We identify a sextic 18-crossing
positive Feynman knot whose rational invariant, a/b=26, is 390 times that of
the cubic 16-crossing non-alternating knot with maximal D_9 symmetry. Our

solitons in the standard model. We evaluate the effective action for winding
configurations in Weinberg-Salam theory without U(1)-gauge fields or fermions.
For a configuration whose size, $a \ll m^{-1}$ where $m = \max{m_W,m_H}$, m_W
is the W-mass, and m_H is the Higgs mass, the static energy goes like
$g^{-2}m_W^2a [1+b_0g^2\ln(1/ma)]^{c_0/b_0}$ in the semiclassical limit. Here g
is the SU(2)-gauge coupling constant and b_0, c_0 are positive numbers
determined by renormalization-group techniques. We discuss the limitations of
this result for extremely small configurations and conclude that quantum
fluctuations do not stabilize winding configurations where we have confidence
in SU(2)-Higgs as a renormalizable field theory.",0.18864588,-0.13221532,-0.041594423,0.077983275,0.14167078,-0.41919452,0.29690224,0.138207,0.14707667,-0.113138065,0.08110578,0.08193931,0.046082266,0.13075888,0.058847487,0.12797195,0.033163887,-0.037382178,0.26643866,0.1376877,-0.097520344,0.14601147,0.12121377,-0.094985165,-0.017674103,0.01694176,0.18744975,0.09878525,-0.07885349,0.15017238,-0.19041847,0.16182896,0.08558993,-0.08889194,0.132781,0.005605381,-0.07528927,-0.017186578,-0.11273405,-0.084319144,0.04269905,-0.15141746,-0.20323493,-0.09501089,-0.10649387,-0.18348882,-0.23386538,-0.14007452,-0.24483809,0.117258504,0.028700754,0.22950728,-0.17990685,0.09343383,-0.12898463,0.2505795,0.020770786,0.22474475,-0.28419486,0.18282573,0.045396693,0.10607368,-0.11311871,0.2329621,0.096540265,0.26751244,-0.16986382,0.40907174,-0.061054777,-0.058763504,-0.024400588,-0.08299134,-0.09675964,-0.12082922,0.033176623,-0.038912226,-0.005821459,-0.07734309,0.17098218,0.015716687,0.16042718,0.16635795,0.1014333,-0.25294673,0.089470625,0.034557994,-0.001989141,-0.019155297,-0.069842026,0.11972754,0.04106672,-0.0031287558,0.02947479,0.000885468,0.058497302,0.08260961,0.10111893,0.024133082,0.07906239,0.01218162,-0.35735545,-0.0091067925,0.08102581,0.18855268,-0.08385311,0.049277775,0.35693818,0.14974096,-0.117675915,0.11846594,0.15411863,-0.18375854,-0.12263723,0.06524467,0.086555526,0.18169656,-0.0072941175,-0.30776212,0.106192335,0.058254447,-0.08117834,0.1410901,0.101885796,-0.16745122,-0.005822122,-0.07138961,0.08037338,-0.026167732
9611219,1996,"We construct a one-loop effective metric describing the evaporation phase of
a Schwarzschild black hole in a spherically symmetric null-dust model. This is
achieved by quantising the Vaidya solution and by chosing a time dependent
quantum state. This state describes a black hole which is initially in thermal
equilibrium and then the equilibrium is switched off, so that the black hole
starts to evaporate, shrinking to a zero radius in a finite proper time. The
naked singularity appears, and the Hawking flux diverges at the end-point.
However, a static metric can be imposed in the future of the end-point.
Although this end-state metric cannot be determined within our construction, we
show that it cannot be a flat metric.",0.074272335,0.49691406,0.5048046,0.2125209,-0.2621432,0.20514274,0.38908434,-0.4503355,-0.70748687,0.16092151,-0.13176745,-0.0746201,0.45661235,0.5900969,0.15459853,0.42774767,0.4854867,0.07352387,0.24991615,-0.039934132,0.36464652,-0.40201357,0.16379109,-0.31494093,0.48123923,0.121139735,0.2684851,0.46168277,0.31055638,0.30637383,0.28771085,-0.3241526,0.36536226,-0.101473704,0.24025528,-0.0035834014,-0.4264052,-0.040287316,0.35447183,-0.06128639,0.04425484,0.21032202,-0.4974835,0.008639827,0.35268867,0.34425044,-0.39032355,0.4102242,-0.56550634,-0.036919326,0.03168696,-0.19642995,-0.29258302,0.06819883,-0.1371202,-0.10004978,-0.025055977,0.053073913,-0.07792412,-0.04213053,-0.01513131,0.17027067,-0.32495826,0.18253215,0.5893641,0.23132572,-0.042372644,0.054601923,-0.20022434,0.4867221,0.30686113,-0.052145988,-0.5859832,-0.19160722,0.26622397,-0.5845553,-0.5984503,0.63562566,0.1794903,-0.15297882,-0.20677122,0.1901828,0.06857009,-0.5283331,0.37483698,0.7151824,0.2550944,-0.16674909,0.27096897,0.060839493,-0.47154617,0.11781672,-0.56431806,-0.20517482,-0.17514998,0.20204669,0.11374509,-0.33707085,0.29156506,0.26563123,0.029649138,-0.100911334,0.11648328,0.26391447,0.28836766,0.6435605,0.2713567,0.09978639,-0.14438443,0.37305897,-0.21037762,-0.3183025,0.12716216,0.1853932,0.3220344,0.3049525,-0.4026034,-0.015457094,0.08085253,-0.30620965,-0.32681397,-0.037978128,0.04009065,-0.59572536,-0.055991918,0.39997822,-0.07322124,0.045146137
9804082,1998,"The beautiful scenario of pre-big-bang cosmology is appealling not only
because it is more or less derived from string theory, but also because it
separates clearly the problem of the initial conditions for the universe from
that of high curvatures. Recently, the pre-big-bang program was subject to
attack from on the grounds that pre-big-bang cosmology does not solve the
horizon and flatness problems in a ``natural'' way, as customary exponential
``new'' inflation does. In particular, it appears that an arbitrarily small
deviation from perfect flatness in the initial state can not be accommodated.
For this analysis, matter in the universe before the big bang was assumed to be
radiation. We perform a similar analysis to theirs, but using the equation of
state for ``string matter'' $\rho=-3p$ which seems more appropriate to the
physical situation and, also, is motivated by the scale factor duality (in the
flat case) with respect to our expanding, radiation dominated, universe. For an
open universe we find, exactly, the same time-dependence of the scale factor as
in the Milne universe, recently found to represent the universal attractor at
$t=-\infty $ of all pre big bang cosmologies. We conclude that our radiation
dominated universe comes from a flat rather than a curved region.",0.100018434,0.061199114,-0.076633,0.054001357,0.27561396,-0.34417716,0.059877545,0.33131427,-0.080368385,-0.10292369,-0.08694644,-0.08045931,-0.16774765,0.07999354,0.068618424,0.095338985,-0.026720278,-0.00624582,-0.089127,0.23571804,-0.23181573,0.090346016,-0.011487015,0.09062054,0.05593833,-0.004618652,-0.25587058,0.024941713,0.013598716,0.066869184,0.047997825,0.11532238,0.13894518,0.15034224,0.04632494,-0.002297055,-0.18898383,0.033443123,0.04947837,0.21519955,-0.0012056828,-0.0701922,-0.111120924,-0.18099973,0.044845447,-0.16628307,-0.1847691,0.06658791,-0.0520804,-0.095511705,0.083541475,0.2653674,-0.074967325,0.094029695,0.012005053,-0.21807784,-0.23720415,0.26655877,-0.06564797,-0.025840402,0.089682534,0.08590576,0.044983685,-0.054624304,0.0036101937,-0.08318655,0.09308724,0.15614153,0.23321784,0.12673503,0.014048047,-0.08711972,-0.008196212,-0.12358182,0.03991723,0.033822395,-0.049003653,-0.12727906,0.13826936,-0.057936825,-0.05266905,0.05640541,-0.074846625,-0.11322404,-0.17769602,-0.25273156,0.047448486,0.06310569,-0.030214474,-0.11245838,-0.004192779,-0.045543995,0.025770426,-0.07008405,0.2041917,0.12714964,0.09965359,0.060789887,-0.001454968,0.01741089,-0.08880244,0.054578062,0.082373604,0.13899335,0.25876343,-0.097099975,-0.01022017,0.06656673,0.054114435,0.23328051,-0.20637679,-0.09543891,0.110572025,0.1366467,0.11800565,0.0599714,0.104962245,-0.058021195,-0.047988698,-0.14442047,0.059521124,-0.057591163,-0.031726122,0.03125618,-0.018403579,0.021700466,0.21974728,0.07655634

9710179,1997,"We describe mirror symmetry in N=2 superconformal field theories in terms of
a dynamical topology changing process of the principal fiber bundle associated
with a topological membrane. We show that the topological symmetries of
Calabi-Yau sigma-models can be obtained from discrete geometric transformations
of compact Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to charged matter fields. We
demonstrate that the appearence of magnetic monopole-instantons, which
interpolate between topologically inequivalent vacua of the gauge theory,
implies that the discrete symmetry group of the worldsheet theory is realized
kinematically in three dimensions as the magnetic flux symmetry group. From
this we construct the mirror map and show that it corresponds to the
interchange of topologically non-trivial matter field and gauge degrees of
freedom. We also apply the mirror transformation to the mean field theory of
the quantum Hall effect. We show that it maps the Jain hierarchy into a new
hierarchy of states in which the lowest composite fermions have the same

of quasi-classical limit. Its Lax formalism, W-infinity symmetries and general
solutions are shown to be reproduced from their counterparts in the KP

pointlike scatterer in one and two dimensions. By varying the location and the
strength of the scatterer, we systematically find diabolical degeneracies among

9910197,1999,"We compute two-point functions of chiral operators Tr \Phi^3 in {\cal N}=4
SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to the order g^4 in perturbation theory.
We perform explicit calculations using {\cal N}=1 superspace techniques and
find that perturbative corrections to the correlators vanish for all N. While
at order g^2 the cancellations can be ascribed to the nonrenormalization
theorem valid for correlators of operators in the same multiplet as the stress
tensor, at order g^4 this argument no longer applies and the actual
cancellation occurs in a highly nontrivial way. Our result is obtained in

consistent background for $N=2$ closed superstring theory in $2+2\-$dimensions,
can accommodate the recently discovered two-dimensional dilaton gravity black
hole solution, {\it via} appropriate dimensional reductions and truncations.
Interestingly, the usual dilaton field in this set of solutions emerges from
the scalar field in the ${\bf 70}\-$dimensional representation of an intrinsic
global $SO(8)$ group. We also give a set of exact solutions, which can be
interpreted as the dilaton field on Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton
background, realized in an $N=1$ self-dual supergravity theory. This suggests
that the $N=2$ superstring has a close (even closer) relationship with the
two-dimensional black hole solution, which was originally developed in the
context of bosonic string and $N=1$ superstring. Our result also provides
supporting evidence for the conjecture that the $N=2$ superstring theory is the

9509100,1995,"Given a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra H and its dual H^ we construct
the infinite crossed product A=... x H x H^ x H ... and study its
superselection sectors in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory. A is
the observable algebra of a generalized quantum spin chain with H-order and
H^-disorder symmetries, where by a duality transformation the role of order and
disorder may also appear interchanged. If H=\CC G is a group algebra then A
becomes an ordinary G-spin model. We classify all DHR-sectors of A --- relative
to some Haag dual vacuum representation --- and prove that their symmetry is
described by the Drinfeld double D(H). To achieve this we construct localized
coactions \rho: A \to (A \otimes D(H)) and use a certain compressibility

9707163,1997,"We reanalyse the question whether the quantum Bogomolnyi bound is saturated
in the two-dimensional supersymmetric kink and sine-Gordon models. Our starting
point is the usual expression for the one-loop correction to the mass of a
soliton in terms of sums over zero-point energies. To regulate these sums, most
authors put the system in a box with suitable boundary conditions, and impose
an ultraviolet cut-off. We distinguish between an energy cut-off and a mode
number cut-off, and show that they lead to different results. We claim that
only the mode cut-off yields correct results, and only if one considers exactly
the same number of bosonic and fermionic modes in the total sum over
bound-state and zero-point energies. To substantiate this claim, we show that
in the sine-Gordon model only the mode cut-off yields a result for the quantum
soliton mass that is consistent with the exact result for the spectrum as
obtained by Dashen et al. from quantising the so-called breather solution. In
the supersymmetric case, our conclusion is that contrary to previous claims the
quantum Bogomolnyi bound is not saturated in any of the two-dimensional models
considered.",-0.22563553,0.12181844,-0.22146972,-0.25404406,0.006494183,0.19813652,0.06020549,0.077200934,-0.17895724,0.16032836,0.067898095,-0.11383235,-0.079209626,-0.24970864,-0.1545792,-0.23220071,0.017160624,-0.07264609,-0.07354003,-0.02825366,-0.11029559,0.09848763,-0.10269082,-0.06946966,0.18045679,0.23942207,0.09758523,0.18743372,-0.021345697,-0.23674808,-0.18411507,0.14235803,-0.05212076,-0.021673117,0.124884,-0.00285721,0.055259198,-0.14428368,-0.0051446185,0.09861007,0.056168064,-0.31300178,0.097604625,-0.017754216,-0.19015437,-0.107247055,0.35356528,-0.133624,0.053663377,0.20583215,-0.17614639,-0.056713633,-0.075994685,0.09978196,-0.031526662,-0.18677853,0.028894573,-0.019498587,0.19475308,0.038765483,-0.047567815,-0.068435565,-0.13535282,-0.024847055,0.011289358,0.16576217,0.15069418,-0.090348795,0.039378643,-0.116952986,0.11784758,0.10248089,0.23371035,-0.0047097355,0.003349755,-0.029207427,0.18405202,0.16018009,0.01578886,0.17970714,0.21870384,-0.09038421,0.22368366,0.18748626,0.1542493,-0.23843424,0.04219939,-0.07364626,0.03616499,0.01070318,0.08610366,-0.14125893,-0.10197733,0.0075185634,0.0041814987,0.058266684,0.13743085,-0.029861614,-0.04389354,-0.15095972,-0.075594276,0.14062181,0.106883414,-0.06559683,0.022743009,0.04453083,0.106337026,0.2916142,0.03554069,-0.19163372,-0.09113315,0.22201997,0.19025439,-0.07798873,-0.10718262,-0.15181284,-0.085680045,0.15066077,-0.037520096,0.0854402,-0.27657008,0.17365277,-0.10340624,0.1375643,-0.04137245,0.13643369,0.27592742,-0.1731121
9503064,1995,"Recently, using the model of $N=2$ supergravity --- vector multiplets
interaction with the scalar field geometry $SU(1,m)/SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ as an
example, we have shown that even when the scalar field geometry is fixed, one
can have a whole family of the Lagrangians, which differ by vector field
duality transformation. In this paper we carry out the construction of such
families for the case of $N=3$ and $N=4$ supergravities, the scalar field
geometry being $SU(3,m)/SU(3)\otimes SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ and
$SU(1,1)/U(1)\otimes O(6,m)/O(6)\otimes O(m)$, correspondingly. Moreover, it
turns out that these families contain, as a partial case, the models describing
the interaction of arbitrary number of vector multiplets with our hidden
sectors, admitting spontaneous supersymmetry breaking without a cosmological

9712046,1997,"Various features of domain walls in supersymmetric gluodynamics are
discussed. We give a simple field-theoretic interpretation of the phenomenon of
strings ending on the walls recently conjectured by Witten. An explanation of
this phenomenon in the framework of gauge field theory is outlined. The
phenomenon is argued to be particularly natural in supersymmetric theories
which support degenerate vacuum states with distinct physical properties. The
issue of existence (or non-existence) of the BPS saturated walls in the
theories with glued (super)potentials is addressed. The amended
Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian belongs to this class. The physical
origin of the cusp structure of the effective Lagrangian is revealed, and the
limitation it imposes on the calculability of the wall tension is explained.
Related problems are considered. In particular, it is shown that the so called

standard model of particle physics and show promise for unifying all forces.
After a brief introduction to supersymmetry, we discuss the prospects for its
experimental discovery in the near future. We then show how the magic of
supersymmetry allows us to solve certain quantum field theories exactly, thus
leading to new insights about field theory dynamics related to
electric-magnetic duality. The discussion of superstring theory starts with its
perturbation expansion, which exhibits new features including ``stringy
geometry.'' We then turn to more recent non-perturbative developments. Using
new dualities, all known superstring theories are unified, and their strong
coupling behavior is clarified. A central ingredient is the existence of

9709214,1997,"We explicitly construct soliton solutions in the low energy description of
M-theory on S^1/Z_2. It is shown that the 11-dimensional membrane is a BPS
solution of this theory if stretched between the Z_2 hyperplanes. A similar
statement holds for the 11-dimensional 5--brane oriented parallel to the
hyperplanes. The parallel membrane and the orthogonal 5-brane, though
solutions, break all supersymmetries. Furthermore, we construct the analog of
the gauge 5-brane with gauge instantons on the hyperplanes. This solution

in a plane is considered. In the presence of a hard core repulsion, which
prevents the Ising spins from overlapping, the model is analogous to a

exhibits multicritical behavior, with first and second order transition lines

9709044,1997,"An $SO(9,1)$ invariant formulation of an 11-dimensional supermembrane is
presented by combining an $SO(10,1)$ invariant treatment of reparametrization
symmetry with an $SO(9,1)$ invariant $\theta_{R} = 0$ gauge of
$\kappa$-symmetry. The Lagrangian thus defined consists of polynomials in
dynamical variables (up to quartic terms in $X^{\mu}$ and up to the eighth
power in $\theta$), and reparametrization BRST symmetry is manifest. The area
preserving diffeomorphism is consistently incorporated and the area preserving
gauge symmetry is made explicit. The $SO(9,1)$ invariant theory contains terms
which cannot be induced by a naive dimensional reduction of higher dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The $SO(9,1)$ invariant Hamiltonian and the
generator of area preserving diffeomorphism together with the supercharge are
matrix regularized by applying the standard procedure. As an application of the

9205006,1992,"Following the reasoning of Claudson and Halpern, it is shown that
""fifth-time"" stabilized quantum gravity is equivalent to Langevin evolution
(i.e. stochastic quantization) between fixed non-singular, but otherwise
arbitrary, initial and final states. The simple restriction to a fixed final
state at $t_5 \rightarrow \infty$ is sufficient to stabilize the theory. This
equivalence fixes the integration measure, and suggests a particular
operator-ordering, for the fifth-time action of quantum gravity. Results of a
numerical simulation of stabilized, latticized Einstein-Cartan theory on some
small lattices are reported. In the range of cosmological constant $\l$
investigated, it is found that: 1) the system is always in the broken phase
$<det(e)> \ne 0$; and 2) the negative free energy is large, possibly singular,
in the vincinity of $\l = 0$. The second finding may be relevant to the
cosmological constant problem.",-0.011046618,-0.12993538,-0.023304509,-0.36615536,0.03341627,0.018835992,0.19127958,-0.060791716,-0.15063778,0.15370053,-0.034808964,0.065907344,-0.041972984,0.042922378,-0.0126064755,0.13787374,-0.09159775,0.025878794,0.098149225,-0.042413723,0.025976747,0.22881603,0.09740903,0.067367084,-0.15058716,0.095280275,-0.028063416,0.0470995,0.0560492,-0.39520943,0.071730845,-0.36429518,-0.047950387,0.11741658,0.1080511,-0.23712803,-0.010167509,-0.13397622,0.12798864,-0.109121084,-0.079268605,0.06979922,0.11717507,0.25899836,-0.049958423,-0.052729964,0.1325396,-0.079963565,0.10567719,0.17508177,-0.021627985,0.011179473,-0.122177556,-0.0067579374,-0.036280718,0.16655669,0.278577,-0.012541622,-0.05898738,0.30091858,0.021416962,0.008891679,-0.09071045,0.28846043,0.18096098,0.12636973,0.08346393,-0.041672684,-0.004829988,0.026785761,-0.012519315,0.088717,0.26930588,0.028875217,-0.0037568063,-0.26955432,0.1403281,-0.1459698,-0.09007226,0.059953492,0.20037118,0.043068707,0.23945756,-0.026613176,-0.2516074,0.10266709,-0.15267104,0.37132806,-0.19553152,-0.031617995,-0.1794867,-0.017003916,-0.23801962,0.1469864,-0.0019866545,0.3178151,0.06596979,0.043673474,0.058204636,-0.042114355,0.25825077,-0.16782828,0.19111568,-0.24044156,-0.025903337,-0.16316587,0.009219483,0.060028926,-0.029957699,-0.310347,-0.021507159,0.093853734,-0.06918509,-0.06726454,0.11673392,0.027153894,0.16250451,0.13571307,0.17694774,0.21841234,0.11379235,0.21112752,-0.0020774603,0.038678087,0.3123862,-0.025300294,0.11808835,0.12579024
9804057,1998,"We find aspects of electrically confining large $N$ Yang-Mills theories on
$T^2 \times R^{d-2}$ which are consistent with a $GL(2,Z)$ duality. The modular
parameter associated with this $GL(2,Z)$ is given by ${m\over N} + i\Lambda^2
A$, where $A$ is the area of the torus, $m$ is the t'Hooft twist on the torus,
and $\Lambda^2$ is the string tension. $N$ is taken to infinity keeping $m\over
N$ and $g^2N$ fixed. This duality may be interpreted as T-duality of the QCD
string if one identifies the magnetic flux with a two-form background in the
string theory. Our arguments make no use of supersymmetry. While we are not
able to show that this is an exact self duality of conventional QCD, we
conjecture that it may be applicable within the universality class of QCD. We
discuss the status of the conjecture for the soluble case of pure two
dimensional Euclidean QCD on $T^2$, which is almost but not exactly self dual.
For higher dimensional theories, we discuss qualitative features consistent
with duality. For $m=0$, such a duality would lead to an equivalence between
pure QCD on $R^4$ and QCD on $R^2$ with two adjoint scalars. When $\Lambda^2 A
<< m^2/N^2$, the proposed duality includes exchanges of rank with twist. This
exchange bears some resemblance, but is not equivalent, to Nahm duality. A
proposal for an explicit perturbative map which implements duality in this
limit is discussed.",-0.25273657,0.27546558,-0.009345114,0.07365292,0.26821545,-0.052048057,0.21536285,-0.205291,-0.23638958,-0.057393014,-0.051410414,-0.10373981,-0.122292355,-0.34140417,-0.32200158,0.24772292,0.09088762,-0.02277247,-0.09232721,-0.16338933,0.21711081,0.03946863,0.23827428,-0.107079625,0.14467324,-0.108596444,-0.05561941,0.1698347,0.26628017,0.13626587,0.33308733,-0.09602793,0.06783139,-0.112687275,0.069751516,-0.049607173,-0.3105104,0.04172504,-0.025768027,0.2433945,-0.028130442,-0.23640797,0.21766005,0.050493218,-0.20997211,-0.14344305,0.37332815,0.13382995,-0.1252391,0.27697572,0.07554666,0.06975006,0.09651247,0.051359832,-0.02406542,0.13316944,-0.21990919,-0.038985476,0.017463714,-0.05758506,-0.13848817,-0.040549397,0.046908006,-0.3868292,0.09445338,-0.01655595,0.21801385,0.14006002,-0.2766174,-0.32560164,0.18375212,-0.06372756,0.13165659,-0.11417095,0.16974619,-0.11422601,-0.031418294,-0.09824411,0.0319044,-0.10483566,-0.05057293,0.15286139,0.03266652,-0.006732598,0.13360399,-0.14326584,0.022877,-0.22723415,-0.08206344,-0.02920336,-0.24593185,0.32238784,-0.22504981,0.22546574,-0.044232108,0.23580457,0.03429162,-0.27628294,-0.2556455,0.11253478,0.025368158,0.0015064776,0.29136252,-0.16884312,-0.12978016,-0.0736337,-0.18276231,-0.055300277,-0.043426737,-0.29535016,0.10256894,0.06999119,-0.2296803,0.04905595,0.023446396,-0.0788832,0.08519737,0.16536891,0.046635836,-0.011910744,-0.10985295,-0.027315315,-0.07718888,-0.07107547,-0.23060934,0.08050645,-0.35498106,-0.07700029
9805191,1998,"The non-commutative algebra which defines the theory of zero-branes on
$T^4/Z_2$ allows a unified description of moduli spaces associated with
zero-branes, two-branes and four-branes on the orbifold space. Bundles on a

discuss these moduli spaces in the context of dualities of K3

Zero-branes on the degenerate limits of the compact orbifold lead to fixed

relaxation phenomena of moduli fields to background consisting of a BPS soliton

effects to the BPS black hole mass spectra and to their dynamical relaxation.
We show that, despite non-renormalizability of string effective supergravity,
quantum effect modifies BPS mass spectra only through coupling constant and
moduli field renormalizations. Based on target-space duality, we establish a
perturbative non-renormalization theorem and obatin exact BPS black hole mass
and entropy in terms of renormalized string loop-counting parameter and
renormalized moduli fields. We show that similar conclusion holds, in the large

9610155,1996,"Geometric Killing spinors which exist on AdS_{p+2} X S^{d-p-2} sometimes may
be identified with supersymmetric Killing spinors. This explains the
enhancement of unbroken supersymmetry near the p-brane horizon in d dimensions.
The corresponding p-brane interpolates between two maximally supersymmetric
vacua, at infinity and at the horizon. New case is studied here: p=0, d=5. The

9503198,1995,"A simple connection between the universal $R$ matrix of $U_q(sl(2))$ (for
spins $\demi$ and $J$) and the required form of the co-product action of the
Hilbert space generators of the quantum group symmetry is put forward. This
gives an explicit operator realization of the co-product action on the
covariant operators. It allows us to derive the quantum group covariance of the
fusion and braiding matrices, although it is of a new type: the generators
depend upon worldsheet variables, and obey a new central extension of
$U_q(sl(2))$ realized by (what we call) fixed point commutation relations. This
is explained by showing that the link between the algebra of field
transformations and that of the co-product generators is much weaker than
previously thought. The central charges of our extended $U_q(sl(2))$ algebra,
which includes the Liouville zero-mode momentum in a nontrivial way are related
to Virasoro-descendants of unity. We also show how our approach can be used to
derive the Hopf algebra structure of the extended quantum-group symmetry
$U_q(sl(2))\odot U_{\qhat}(sl(2))$ related to the presence of both of the

9404162,1994,"After adding a scalar chiral boson to the usual superspace variables, the
four-dimensional Green-Schwarz superstring is quantized in a manifestly SO(3,1)
super-Poincar\'e covariant manner. The constraints are all first-class and form
an N=2 superconformal algebra with $c=-3$. Since the Calabi-Yau degrees of
freedom are described by an N=2 superconformal field theory with $c=9$, the
combined Green-Schwarz and Calabi-Yau systems form the $c=6$ matter sector of a
critical N=2 string.
  Using the standard N=2 super-Virasoro ghosts, a nilpotent BRST charge is
defined and vertex operators for the massless supermultiplets are constructed.
Four-dimensional superstring amplitudes can be calculated with manifest SO(3,1)
super-Poincar\'e invariance by evaluating correlation functions of these
BRST-invariant vertex operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces.",0.010537803,0.02417273,-0.14079413,-0.22441953,-0.00026305392,-0.0024109483,0.18203498,0.043896973,-0.10972664,0.015454307,-0.13088493,-0.06529231,-0.10126245,-0.025716335,-0.11693844,-0.13306804,-0.0060167555,-0.252963,-0.12582631,-0.1406858,0.09127846,0.17945334,0.4115391,-0.1267037,0.07335901,0.13111266,-0.0054161996,0.13689408,-0.114922404,-0.035939753,0.13796103,-0.0005856231,-0.09756118,-0.15881142,0.061101332,-0.06689384,-0.043397546,0.042178944,-0.03298463,-0.036309347,0.075714916,-0.11684906,-0.084952295,-0.11548219,-0.16462421,0.22243997,0.24696104,-0.16497916,0.09649055,0.031886995,0.049222805,-0.24463832,0.0028530285,0.15454465,0.021590605,-0.0343567,0.027904969,-0.078452244,0.368737,-0.20105946,0.1887422,0.27749306,-0.014448265,0.10340374,0.025740616,0.10905734,-0.119036615,0.1804792,0.015563145,-0.14658429,-0.023853175,0.023329347,0.22140896,0.15612008,0.02296694,-0.018123604,0.11140451,-0.0015762523,-0.04293988,0.2835445,0.16738679,0.013476782,0.16170299,0.079409495,0.27545053,0.25822565,0.06764413,-0.014953829,0.020819843,0.07249132,-0.07084219,-0.08684343,-0.14166296,-0.065835066,0.072777696,0.18142782,-0.079744644,-0.021186948,-0.028487891,0.0028171837,0.010624919,0.06831972,-0.047658384,-0.0010793661,0.033266943,-0.013582582,0.084600866,0.22112897,0.04853923,-0.07433231,-0.13985644,0.0061754556,0.15175262,-0.14457263,0.060544997,-0.10841611,0.15207571,-0.010531694,-0.20623004,-0.072761126,0.13259792,-0.081665516,0.120778024,0.09251431,-0.091450214,0.20901941,-0.06660023,0.07973969

9811077,1998,"Using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations of motion we
investigate topological solitons of a modified O(3) sigma model in three space
dimensions, in which the solitons are stabilized by the Hopf charge. We find
that for solitons up to charge five the solutions have the structure of closed
strings, which become increasingly twisted as the charge increases. However,
for higher charge the solutions are more exotic and comprise linked loops and

9601066,1996,"Possible geometric frameworks for a unified theory of gravity and
electromagnetism are investigated: General relativity is enlarged by allowing
for an arbitrary complex linear connection and by constructing an extended
spinor derivative based on the complex connection. Thereby the spacetime
torsion not only is coupled to the spin of fermions and causes a four-fermion
contact interaction, but the non-metric vector-part of torsion is also related

9412160,1994,"Exact instanton solutions to $D=11$ spherical supermembranes moving in flat
target spacetime backgrounds are construted. Our starting point is Super
Yang-Mills theories, based on the infinite dimensional $SU(\infty)$ group,
dimensionally reduced to one time dimension. In this fashion the super-Toda
molecule equation is recovered preserving only one supersymmetry out of the
$N=16$ that one would have obtained otherwise. It is conjectured that the
expected critical target spacetime dimensions for the (super) membrane,
($D=11$) $D=27$ is closely related to that of the $noncritical$ (super)
$W_{\infty}$ strings. A BRST analysis of these symmetries should yield
information about the quantum consistency of the ($D=11$) $D=27$ dimensional
(super) membrane. Comments on the role that Skyrmions might play in the two

9812237,1998,"We observe that the existence of black holes limits the extent to which M
Theory (or indeed any quantum theory of gravity) can be described by
conventional quantum mechanics. Although there is no contradiction with the
fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, one can prove that expectation
values of Heisenberg operators at fixed times cannot exist in an ordinary
asymptotic Lorentz frame. Only operators whose matrix elements between the
vacuum and energy eigenstates with energy greater than the Planck scale are
artificially cut off, can have conventional Green's functions. This implies a
Planck scale cutoff on the possible localization of measurements in time. A
similar behavior arises also in ``little string theories''. We argue that
conventional quantum mechanics in light cone time is compatible with the
properties of black holes if there are more than four non-compact flat
dimensions, and also with the properties of ``little string theories''. We
contrast these observations with what is known about M Theory in asymptotically

9711003,1997,"$D$ dimensional neutral black strings wrapped on a circle are related to
$(D-1)$ dimensional charged black holes by boosts. We show that the boost has
to be performed in the covering space and the boosted coordinate has to be
compactified on a circle with a Lorentz contracted radius. Using this fact we
show that the transition between Schwarzschild black holes to black p-branes
observed recently in M theory is the well-known black hole- black string
transition viewed in a boosted frame. In a similar way the correspondence point
where an excited string state goes over to a neutral black hole is mapped
exactly to the correspondence point for black p-branes. In terms of the $p$
brane quantities the equation of state for an excited string state becomes
identical to that of a 3+1 dimensional massless gas for all $p$. Finally, we
show how boosts can be used to relate Hawking radiation rates. Using the known
microscopic derivation of absorption by extremal 3-branes and near-extremal 5D
holes with three large charges we provide a microscopic derivation of
absorption of 0-branes by seven and five dimensional Schwarzschild black holes

9907119,1999,"Topological quantum field theories can be used as a powerful tool to probe
geometry and topology in low dimensions. Chern-Simons theories, which are
examples of such field theories, provide a field theoretic framework for the
study of knots and links in three dimensions. These are rare examples of
quantum field theories which can be exactly (non-perturbatively) and explicitly
solved. Abelian Chern-Simons theory provides a field theoretic interpretation
of the linking and self-linking numbers of a link. In non-Abelian theories,
vacuum expectation values of Wilson link operators yield a class of polynomial
link invariants; the simplest of them is the famous Jones polynomial. Other
invariants obtained are more powerful than that of Jones. Powerful methods for
completely analytical and non-perturbative computation of these knot and link
invariants have been developed. In the process answers to some of the open
problems in knot theory are obtained. From these invariants for unoriented and
framed links in $S^3$, an invariant for any three-manifold can be easily
constructed by exploiting the Lickorish-Wallace surgery presentation of
three-manifolds. This invariant up to a normalization is the partition function
of the Chern-Simons field theory. Even perturbative analysis of the
Chern-Simons theories are rich in their mathematical structure; these provide a
field theoretic interpretation of Vassiliev knot invariants. Not only in
mathematics, Chern-Simons theories find important applications in three and
four dimensional quantum gravity also.",0.24765405,0.4340517,-0.251658,0.021860078,0.34161,-0.24069765,0.35364702,0.3708081,-0.11540213,-0.2074672,-0.19900562,0.16086194,-0.04274752,-0.4579751,0.04982861,0.08471915,-0.17242756,-0.090046056,-0.30290425,-0.10263673,0.19394365,-0.1237288,-0.04897274,-0.13556366,0.25113735,0.031614125,0.03398548,0.22364502,0.5844854,0.16512235,0.31187987,0.18983601,0.49724728,-0.16895589,0.37731624,0.06574443,-0.62603945,0.39880008,-0.2844925,0.60249954,0.18431358,0.11876285,-0.1417584,-0.047462948,-0.19638568,0.023023728,0.0092715025,0.27336597,0.077966355,0.2897283,-0.20305908,0.3270657,0.1468345,0.008204982,0.2146971,-0.4764732,-0.40543988,0.25907874,0.04314488,0.155862,0.023068164,-0.86830354,0.26173544,-0.35063273,0.019995669,0.099889725,-0.22211795,0.18517531,0.41809797,-0.035696656,-0.19197927,-0.24427119,-0.014169201,-0.4733561,-0.21890262,-0.18758267,0.0043164194,-0.22818242,0.14242256,0.048115242,-0.03350026,-0.17437817,-0.18145853,-0.061051197,-0.060731947,-0.15966259,0.097646184,-0.45068935,0.31284094,-0.07599112,0.07910818,-0.11626442,0.31018364,0.19701141,-0.20710209,0.034904703,0.25625342,-0.051312156,-0.44882876,-0.2202597,0.10349967,0.27692288,0.20455801,-0.31047884,-0.163053,-0.13172734,0.20357424,0.26584512,-0.2390221,0.02648101,-0.45020893,0.42924726,-0.19711068,-0.11277878,0.14352155,0.009332821,0.058512956,0.18846464,-0.39798743,-0.0074313283,0.36582333,-0.38026777,0.008277878,0.15105139,-0.030745476,-0.62499976,0.1141719,-0.21254884
9902071,1999,"Inflationary solutions are constructed in a specific five-dimensional model
with boundaries motivated by heterotic M-theory. We concentrate on the case
where the vacuum energy is provided by potentials on those boundaries. It is
pointed out that the presence of such potentials necessarily excites bulk
Kaluza-Klein modes. We distinguish a linear and a non-linear regime for those
modes. In the linear regime, inflation can be discussed in an effective
four-dimensional theory in the conventional way. We lift a four-dimensional
inflating solution up to five dimensions where it represents an inflating
domain wall pair. This shows explicitly the inhomogeneity in the fifth
dimension. We also demonstrate the existence of inflating solutions with
unconventional properties in the non-linear regime. Specifically, we find
solutions with and without an horizon between the two boundaries. These
solutions have certain problems associated with the stability of the additional
dimension and the persistence of initial excitations of the Kaluza-Klein modes.",0.133696,0.07865588,-0.08332406,-0.16133656,-0.08784371,0.10916793,-0.10120612,0.027079329,0.14487761,0.35535416,-0.16117099,-0.13234645,0.19754484,-0.035231218,0.06194062,-0.17923836,-0.05390501,0.1559804,0.34853956,-0.21867733,-0.16398537,0.2536894,-0.0184393,-0.023439623,-0.15068504,0.11885792,0.05340094,0.099553674,-0.24329168,0.0081303865,-0.16289365,-0.087065995,-0.086521514,-0.08176171,-0.08134439,-0.005495835,0.041611277,0.053479105,-0.029303305,0.17855254,-0.08910749,0.18982057,-0.087968625,-0.064035416,0.007946275,0.07251926,0.000877887,-0.22818512,0.097157404,0.18379481,-0.13728185,-0.0714879,0.038158238,0.062302887,0.2267435,-0.28279912,0.006834531,-0.18089047,0.31098613,0.012690795,0.17376249,0.06253763,-0.021219395,-0.07683173,0.104940206,0.06653255,-0.18030776,0.06516177,-0.13684423,-0.04752235,0.19123092,-0.049939662,-0.1297194,-0.34728694,-0.035137482,0.26886156,0.29616973,0.08664353,-0.16320209,0.09396657,-0.2468811,-0.18471915,-0.12979254,0.09277311,0.22122909,-0.0774294,0.17392358,0.10496435,0.14072624,0.11176051,-0.080688946,0.11430066,-0.2159208,-0.03791113,-0.17822282,-0.12946093,0.063075006,0.009009317,-0.016001236,0.15190998,0.014448702,0.35451192,0.19229943,0.040472895,-0.04379528,0.2914233,-0.12683891,-0.07503107,0.0028872192,-0.022474468,0.28203732,0.10570763,0.16458663,-0.13518779,0.06863858,0.11915298,0.04901464,-0.04800999,-0.17439376,0.007039865,-0.13336675,-0.09885003,-0.12042011,-0.23162162,0.018368348,0.004283361,-0.19515371,0.09511587

9802152,1998,"We show that the super D-string action is exactly equivalent to the IIB
Green-Schwarz superstring action with some ""theta term"" in terms of the path
integral. Since the ""theta term"" imposes the Gauss law constraint on the
physical state but contributes to neither the mass operator nor the constraints
associated with the kappa symmetry and the reparametrization, this exact
equivalence implies that the impossibility to disentangle the first and second
class fermionic constraints covariantly in the super D-string action is
generally inherited from the IIB Green-Schwarz superstring action except
specific gauge choices which make the ground state massive, such as the static

9304049,1993,"We study the nonunitary representations of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra for the
rational central charges c<3. The resolutions for the irreducible
representations of N=2 SVir in terms of the ""2-d gravity modules"" are obtained
and their characters are computed. The correspondence between the N=2

reduction of the BRST complex of sl(N)/sl(N) coset to the BRST complex of the
W-gravity coupled to the W matter. The case of sl(2) is considered explicitly.

investigated in $4$-dimensional ultrastatic space-time $ R \times H^3/\Gamma$,
$H^3/\Gamma$ being a non-compact hyperbolic manifold with finite volume. Making
use of the Selberg trace formula, the $\zeta$-function related to the small
disturbance operator is constructed. For an arbitrary gravitational coupling,
it is found that $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=0$. The one-loop effective
action is analysed by means of proper-time regularisations and the one-loop
divergences are explicitly found. It is pointed out that, in this special case,
also $\zeta$-function regularisation requires a divergent counterterm, which
however is not necessary in the free massless conformal invariant coupling
case. Finite temperature effects are studied and the high-temperature expansion
is presented. A possible application to the problem of the divergences of the

9901040,1999,"In this work (PartI) the qualitative analysis of statics and dynamics of
defects and textures in liquid crystals is performed with help of meanders and
train tracks. It is argued that similar analysis can be applied to 2+1 gravity.
More rigorous justifications are presentedin the companion paper (PartII).
Meanders were recently introduced by V.Arnold (Siberian J.of Math.
Vol.29,36(1988)). Train tracks were originally introduced by W.Thurston in 1979
in his Princeton U. Lecture Notes (http://www.msri.org/gt3m/) in connection
with description of self-homeomorphisms of 2 dimensional surfaces. Using train
tracks the master equation is obtained which could be used alternatively to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation for 2+1 gravity. Since solution of this equation
requires a large scale numerical work, in this paper we resort to the

9607218,1996,"We discuss a T-duality transformation for the c=1/2 matrix model for the
purpose of studying duality transformations in a possible toy example of
nonperturbative frameworks of string theory. Our approach is to first
investigate the scaling limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the
stochastic Hamiltonian in terms of the dual variables and then compare the
results with those using the original spin variables. It is shown that the
c=1/2 model in the scaling limit is T-duality symmetric in the sphere
approximation. The duality symmetry is however violated when the higher-genus
effects are taken into account, owing to the existence of global Z_2 vector
fields corresponding to nontrivial homology cycles. Some universal properties
of the stochastic Hamiltonians which play an important role in discussing the
scaling limit and have been discussed in a previous work by the last two
authors are refined in both the original and dual formulations. We also report
a number of new explicit results for various amplitudes containing macroscopic

9804008,1998,"The renormalization group flows of the coupling constants for the gauged U(N)
vector model, with N_f massless fermions in the defining representation, are
studied in the large N limit, to all orders in the scalar coupling lambda,
leading order in 1/N, and lowest two orders in the gauge coupling g^2. It is
shown that the restrictions of asymptotic freedom, and the reality of the
coupling constants throughout the flows, places important restrictions on
N_f/N. For the case with massless mesons, these conditions are sufficiently
restrictive to imply the existence of an infrared fixed-point (g_*,lambda_*) in
both couplings. Thus, the consistent massless theory is scale invariant, and in
a non-abelian Coulomb phase. The case of massive mesons, and of spontaneously
broken symmetry is also discussed, with similar, but not identical,
conclusions. Speculations related to the possibility that there is a
non-perturbative (in g^2) breakdown of chiral symmetry are presented.",0.118964195,0.01611816,-0.021016084,0.21873672,-0.10861773,-0.20585787,-0.059477057,-0.13880007,0.049661748,0.015079651,-0.11214316,0.03436269,0.010002134,0.1139294,0.05865157,0.15344374,-0.086438894,0.0686402,-0.008332469,0.08150264,-0.048234195,-0.07267395,-0.12949751,0.05239826,-0.08129771,0.0453734,-0.16205068,-0.18579921,-0.057664767,0.11646092,0.032587644,0.16479358,-0.11456852,-0.0008892226,-0.015916634,0.047984943,-0.1341673,0.13701865,-0.008769579,-0.14077123,-0.014917493,-0.17265087,-0.10490003,-0.08816171,0.1081068,0.30572933,-0.014482893,0.07026897,0.13514912,-0.13621853,0.07075486,-0.03970734,0.0316554,0.07300765,0.09385981,-0.023881234,-0.10445528,-0.117011614,-0.23007917,-0.11603533,-0.017863892,0.062826455,0.10132654,-0.061340205,0.007130049,0.0026647374,0.2274713,-0.11267835,0.18447685,-0.10450435,0.075400054,0.031006854,-0.16311032,0.0059493706,-0.115901396,0.14493662,-0.039938927,0.00239769,0.09129835,-0.1211824,0.067536086,0.004471466,0.046802904,-0.06609481,-0.040370274,-0.04322692,0.013307016,0.18486534,-0.13048844,-0.037225064,-0.02101772,-0.044618357,0.05649004,0.08911155,-0.023421567,-0.043140948,-0.032381993,0.49109244,0.18488054,0.013127961,-0.15863054,-0.15277314,0.09175981,0.026049227,-0.049065515,-0.034480758,0.031919125,-0.06976863,0.2022273,0.054302923,-0.18309797,0.032170247,-0.03568966,0.30133688,-0.0063338354,0.038266115,-0.046759278,-0.20334773,-0.01994804,-0.13289261,0.061985835,0.045998313,-0.12579183,-0.11929524,-0.11629492,0.037629582,0.08375091,0.24117118

expansions and numerical diagonalization. We are mainly interested in results
for general chiral angles but we consider also the superintegrable case. For
the parameter values considered, we find that the band structure of the low-
lying part of the excitation spectrum has the form expected from a
quasiparticle picture with two fundamental particles. Studying the N-dependence
of the spectrum, we confirm the stability of the second fundamental particle in
a limited range of the momentum, even when its energy becomes so high that it
lies very high up among the multiparticle scattering states. This is not a
phenomenon restricted to the superintegrable line. Calculating a
non-translationally invariant correlation function, we give evidence that it is
oscillating. Within our numerical accuracy we find a relation between the
oscillation length and the dip position of the momentum dispersion of the
lightest particle which seems to be quite independent of the chiral angles.",-0.18753582,-0.06656572,-0.18759434,-0.17403941,-0.14713791,0.3850679,0.24468489,-0.17961931,0.07006988,0.10600214,0.11460474,0.17430422,-0.15519303,-0.3450035,0.10166239,-0.25248718,-0.21437216,-0.27339822,0.05822026,-0.15822643,-0.086271465,0.07896766,0.2922455,0.032114238,-0.16467649,0.33470392,0.6223804,-0.042225182,0.13152383,0.21538475,-0.12579948,0.055099398,0.056445874,0.4461323,0.081200555,-0.053880684,0.0071596205,-0.08490803,-0.14709803,0.4335277,-0.0605008,-0.13633814,0.4803939,-0.08493747,-0.28394032,0.09748132,0.49115145,0.25170088,-0.1753253,0.50070155,0.06865594,-0.09554003,0.064493075,0.22932893,-0.1684517,-0.12372566,0.1650059,-0.13746546,-0.0091744065,0.14453804,0.031109437,-0.07708247,-0.3288927,-0.06208653,-0.24304925,0.3558352,0.19137356,-0.21331564,-0.08725442,-0.342024,0.17649816,0.2320754,0.16379803,-0.12180288,0.50714296,0.080065675,0.18816026,0.04214301,0.0008788686,0.050992385,-0.20543598,0.20590466,0.22534569,0.21331891,0.028120816,-0.16185895,0.15255716,-0.39577258,0.36517215,-0.159062,-0.20075217,0.009058908,0.06304048,0.098248154,0.18449257,-0.106068105,-0.04735963,0.24240819,-0.0906889,-0.14074782,-0.05835641,0.051617295,-0.00025357306,-0.083313145,-0.349391,-0.044622023,-0.17806609,-0.199139,0.04951337,-0.3775313,-0.016724855,0.01831284,0.06353572,-0.37186718,-0.22454983,-0.29077643,-0.15163596,-0.10720581,-0.1939354,-0.069210015,-0.48515844,0.036854643,-0.14809339,0.028405376,-0.012816384,-0.098727375,0.15478356,-0.19300702
9509125,1995,"Using canonical quantization we find the Virasoro centre for a class of
conformally-invariant interacting Wess-Zumino-Witten theories. The theories
have a group structure similar to that of Toda theories (both abelian and

9410233,1994,"It has been argued by Ishikawa and Kato that by making use of a specific
bosonization, $c_M=1$ string theory can be regarded as a constrained
topological sigma model. We generalize their construction for any $(p,q)$
minimal model coupled to two dimensional (2d) gravity and show that the
energy--momentum tensor and the topological charge of a constrained topological
sigma model can be mapped to the energy--momentum tensor and the BRST charge of
$c_M<1$ string theory at zero cosmological constant. We systematically study
the physical state spectrum of this topological sigma model and recover the
spectrum in the absolute cohomology of $c_M<1$ string theory. This procedure
provides us a manifestly topological representation of the continuum Liouville

9711091,1997,"We study the structure of the normal matrix model (NMM). We show that all
correlation functions of the model with axially symmetric potentials can be
expressed in terms of holomorphic functions of one variable. This observation
is used to demonstrate the exact solvability of the model. The two-point
correlation function is calculated in the scaling limit by solving the BBGKY
chain of equations. The answer is shown to be universal (i.e. potential
independent up to a change of the scale). We then develop a two-dimensional
free fermion formalism and construct a family of completely integrable
hierarchies (which we call the extended-KP(N) hierarchies) of non-linear
differential equations. The well-known KP hierarchy is a lower-dimensional
reduction of this family. The extended-KP(1) hierarchy contains the
(2+1)-dimensional Burgers equations. The partition function of the N*N NMM is
the tau function of the extended-KP(N) hierarchy invariant with respect to a

9507023,1995,"It has previously been shown that a BRST quantization on an inner product
space leads to physical states of the form |ph>=e^[Q, \psi] |\phi> where |\phi>
is either a trivially BRST invariant state which only depends on the matter
variables, |\phi>_1, or a solution of a Dirac quantization, |\phi>_2. \psi is a
corresponding fermionic gauge fixing operator, \psi_1 or \psi_2. We show here
for abelian and nonabelian models that one may also choose a linear combination
of \psi_1 and \psi_2 for both choices of |\phi> except for a discrete set of
relations between the coefficients. A general form of the coBRST charge

regularization of chiral fermions, that the Nieh-Yan form does contribute to
the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly for spacetimes with generic torsion, and
comment on some of the implications. There are a number of interesting and
important differences with the usual ABJ contributions in the absence of
torsion. For dimensional reasons, the Nieh-Yan contribution is proportional to
the square of the regulator mass. In spacetimes with flat vierbein but
non-trivial torsion, the associated diagrams are actually vacuum polarization
rather than triangle diagrams, and the Nieh-Yan contribution to the ABJ anomaly
arises from the fact that the axial torsion ""photon"" is not transverse.",0.13020939,-0.05308485,-0.008773312,-0.044083014,-0.043967716,0.112551376,0.028733432,0.06559506,0.19143784,0.088117406,0.0938092,-0.25678894,-0.03353534,-0.36688104,-0.15714678,-0.01613754,-0.05238709,0.21705088,0.097463086,-0.24535212,-0.15124536,-0.1058639,-0.023021769,-0.10126808,-0.27485096,-0.19427687,0.09614722,-0.07672134,-0.04890883,-0.082677454,0.10265876,0.16027245,0.12584694,0.27966067,0.35463813,-0.030786864,-0.18468706,-0.07296594,-0.03671729,0.36023486,0.1242512,-0.057926442,-0.013274007,-0.052375976,-0.008734509,-0.22001293,0.20769063,-0.021099444,0.08435949,0.016678005,-0.1201523,-0.072400674,0.17426252,-0.027903855,0.028453745,-0.2088172,0.21721709,-0.37389046,0.09439327,-0.16412085,0.29412317,0.08538467,0.13605013,0.17954239,-0.08040334,0.2720257,-0.032049865,0.08732489,0.23573527,-0.1741065,-0.012285732,0.16068035,0.46274495,-0.3457878,-0.14467147,-0.18538964,-0.0056102276,-0.08619781,-0.10624846,0.21886069,0.1684908,0.17602006,-0.084573776,0.4004205,-0.0037213862,0.18164843,-0.08638839,0.071275,0.13707557,0.021264605,-0.15259084,-0.029538974,0.26320943,0.11081708,0.06464465,0.15515941,0.04400058,-0.009214535,-0.24795036,0.019586932,0.15938124,0.07883969,0.11710929,-0.21075368,0.35113192,-0.053661425,-0.038300328,-0.058528006,0.06917075,0.15618894,0.17635514,-0.0022687614,0.25896752,-0.20378357,-0.16262831,-0.02082111,0.30236936,0.047102556,-0.2833103,0.0009010453,0.05933982,-0.0072443634,-0.03505802,0.084984794,-0.020412862,0.19526093,0.21688703,-0.20587659

time-independent field configuration in a quantum field theory. We study the
Casimir energy in a toy model, where the classical field is replaced by a
separable potential. In this model the exact answer is trivial to compute,
making it a good place to examine subtleties of the problem. We construct two
traditional representations of the Casimir energy, one from the Greens
function, the other from the phase shifts, and apply them to this case. We show
that the two representations are correct and equivalent in this model. We study
the convergence of the Born approximation to the Casimir energy and relate our

supergravity one-loop four-graviton amplitude computed by Green, Gutperle and

configurations of bound states of D-branes wrapping cycles of the
compactification torus. Dp-branes explicitely appear as fluxes on
D(p+2)-branes, and as gauge instantons on D(p+4)-branes. Specific rules for
weighting these contributions are obtained, which should carry over to more
general situations. Furthermore, it is shown that U-duality in D<=6 relates
these D-brane configurations to O(e^{-1/\lambda^2}) instantons for which a
geometric interpretation is still lacking.",-0.026104912,-0.20045447,0.031162044,0.01155591,-0.07434111,0.06115243,-0.09003234,-0.012710236,0.09238063,-0.11643562,-0.17750674,-0.06579917,0.010626446,-0.21979818,-0.10710326,-0.2234636,-0.11847086,-0.041925803,-0.07447192,-0.17462409,0.054231003,0.011810645,0.29026935,0.120737925,0.040123865,0.04737401,0.15045324,-0.03819087,0.22180884,-0.21827295,-0.23101112,0.121384345,-0.08856688,-0.045229033,0.12859857,0.21885493,-0.22257636,0.0024417043,0.01902903,0.15402576,-0.09598441,-0.06340736,0.06593764,-0.060782287,-0.08898357,0.08044599,0.38197702,0.07392834,-0.13078545,-0.14400911,-0.03421715,-0.20816946,0.22135827,-0.15704417,-0.21891516,0.014244512,-0.09846421,-0.2888084,0.061264247,-0.033366546,0.28072494,0.13339189,0.08279706,0.19107929,0.121939965,0.20456675,-0.0005268976,0.104557574,-0.04225313,-0.22124624,-0.22145689,0.18430895,0.02485688,0.013313718,-0.08098527,0.07666865,0.17488015,-0.05791655,0.021598559,-0.015661508,0.08809629,-0.16506192,0.26745006,0.21185352,0.17250323,0.14371571,0.021747036,0.15547743,0.09045908,0.07662181,-0.15811124,-0.035380524,-0.049440965,-0.03389061,-0.10020119,0.05007141,-0.0515931,-0.2991468,-0.0244633,0.11431804,0.04647866,0.14319505,-0.1282415,-0.20540527,0.11446406,-0.16910467,0.089046806,-0.10686676,-0.042866945,-0.26771238,0.2505522,-0.112168305,0.147991,-0.0531433,0.11171093,0.082242005,0.0178492,0.16435881,0.025328368,0.030199563,0.20425785,0.11331845,-0.30083317,0.014710834,-0.25586474,-0.008628041,0.14211637,-0.12963441
9906178,1999,"I briefly review the outcomes of two very different old questions -- where
global SUSY improves on ordinary QFT -- when they are in turn posed in the
local, SUGRA, context. The first concerns the unexpectedly powerful role of the
""Dirac square root"" graded algebra relation $E=Q^2$, originally found in D=4
SUSY by Gol'fand and Likhtman, in proving positive energy theorems both in
SUGRA and in ordinary gravity theories, where $E$ and $Q$ have very different
-- gauge generator -- definitions. The second seeks SUGRA counterparts of the
boson/fermion loop ultraviolet cancellations in SUSY models. Here the result is
negative: local supersymmetry cannot overcome the infinities associated with
the dimensional gravitational $\kappa^2$ even, as recently shown, in maximal
D=11 SUGRA.",-0.054792162,-0.060103875,0.1504612,0.59063995,0.29935142,-0.15125473,0.10327968,-0.00048561394,-0.25141644,-0.12455082,0.088381454,0.26000696,-0.09561257,0.15766045,0.018866891,-0.027897872,-0.16809379,0.011726813,-0.12790558,0.36603272,-0.23278162,-0.32734337,-0.059196852,-0.1470477,-0.058028504,-0.1620231,0.10525273,-0.3201251,-0.061590336,0.19453512,-0.033801794,0.25426942,0.043686498,0.14016153,-0.38561913,0.07724109,0.039325394,-0.08998637,0.001424253,0.056273725,-0.010920685,-0.09872207,0.0348978,-0.4509302,0.061442308,0.21414512,-0.26055056,-0.08076417,-0.040808104,-0.24026863,-0.17424028,-0.07558494,0.07155508,0.094801925,0.2539897,-0.023253003,-0.10990885,0.2658707,-0.252604,0.013370875,0.0040894374,-0.041921865,0.022396127,-0.04548536,0.058460295,-0.017070644,0.08495786,-0.11158168,-0.0597728,0.03369516,-0.09194632,0.0086251125,-0.15238339,0.029586166,0.041948352,0.09648067,-0.22128369,-0.16654448,-0.058499686,-0.0724168,-0.13195318,-0.12707226,0.13147578,-0.088636614,-0.22499005,-0.12987638,-0.027491974,0.13356325,0.0755436,-0.18418975,-0.13321322,-0.061643068,0.05829258,-0.023860179,0.22422974,-0.33139396,-0.1021768,0.39161602,-0.1670033,0.085501276,-0.12295028,-0.093589336,-0.29893854,-0.0875003,-0.084005505,0.20064034,-0.05990284,0.111933365,-0.059580766,0.16645879,-0.16760963,-0.016168939,-0.12892142,0.094888255,0.28002426,-0.02251702,-0.20371366,-0.2575889,0.18056487,0.010842327,-0.03858296,0.093247585,-0.10529799,-0.114512384,0.15693174,0.2221891,0.16461495,-0.19027787

9607201,1996,"These lectures begin by reviewing the evidence for S duality of the
toroidally compactified heterotic string in 4d that was obtained in the period
1992--94. Next they review recently discovered dualities that relate all five
of the 10d superstring theories and a quantum extension of 11d supergravity
called M theory. The study of p-branes of various dimensions (some of which are
D-branes) plays a central role. The final sections survey supersymmetric string
vacua in 6d and some of the dual constructions by which they can be obtained.
Special emphasis is given to a class of N=1 models that exhibit

9307042,1993,"We consider modifications to general relativity by the non-local (classical
and quantum) string effects for the case of a D-dimensional Scwarzschild black
hole. The classical non-local effects do not alter the spacetime topology (the
horizon remains unshifted, at least perturbatively). We suggest a simple
analytic continuation of the perturbative result into the non-perturbative
domain, which eliminates the black hole singularity at the origin and yields an
ultraviolet-finite theory of quantum gravity. We investigate the quantum non-
local effects (including massive modes) and argue that the inclusion of these
back reactions resolves the problem of the thermal spectrum in the semi-
classical approach of field quantization in a black hole background, through
the bootstrap condition. The density of states for both the quantum and thermal
interpretation of the WKB formula are finally shown to differ quant- itatively

studying multiloop Feynman diagrams which constitutes a full-fledged and
inherently more powerful alternative to the BPHZ theory. The new techniques
emerged as a formalization of the reasoning behind a recent series of record

systematic use of the ideas and notions of the distribution theory. We identify
the problem of asymptotic expansion of products of singular functions in the

9707133,1997,"There have been known ""exact"" beta functions for the gauge coupling in N=1
supersymmetric gauge theories, the so-called NSVZ beta functions. Shifman and
Vainshtein (SV) further related these beta functions to the exact 1-loop
running of the ""Wilsonian"" gauge coupling. All these results, however, remain
somewhat mysterious. We attempt to clarify these issues by presenting new
perspectives on the NSVZ beta function. Our interpretation of the results is
somewhat different than the one given by SV, having nothing to do with the
distinction between ""Wilsonian"" and ""1PI"" effective actions. Throughout we work
in the context of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group; namely, as the cutoff of
the theory is changed from M to M', we determine the appropriate changes in the
bare couplings needed to keep the low energy physics fixed. The entire analysis
is therefore free of infrared subtleties. When the bare Lagrangian given at the
cutoff is manifestly holomorphic in the gauge coupling, we show that the
required change in the holomorphic gauge coupling is exhausted at 1-loop to all
orders of perturbation theory, and even non-perturbatively in some cases. On
the other hand, when the bare Lagrangian has canonically normalized kinetic
terms, we find that the required change in the gauge coupling is given by the
NSVZ beta function. The higher order contributions in the NSVZ beta function
are due to anomalous Jacobians under the rescaling of the fields done in
passing from holomorphic to canonical normalization. We also give prescriptions
for regularizing certain N=1 theories with an ultraviolet cutoff M preserving
manifest holomorphy, starting from finite N=4 and N=2 theories. It is then in
principle possible to check the validity of the exact beta function by higher
order calculations in these theories.",-0.1819388,-0.03217329,0.032149293,-0.23678821,0.030209318,0.5239778,-0.16925567,0.019392397,0.20094508,0.10877932,-0.1343098,-0.08007934,0.08426097,-0.08818456,0.07216375,-0.0042957813,-0.07352373,-0.036934238,-0.10338838,0.073830366,-0.06434915,0.11637317,0.028204788,0.15770626,-0.03429119,-0.088041134,-0.040265232,-0.16014138,-0.10131709,-0.22188684,-0.11547764,0.2598078,-0.32794258,0.05312011,0.005332016,0.016381428,-0.006035723,-0.01815635,-0.03721281,0.19406235,-0.10800582,-0.08445518,-0.030907966,-0.01861468,-0.11955118,0.07521588,0.18642594,-0.13273385,0.059500426,0.09051682,0.16661692,0.009267056,-0.2346088,-0.13033003,0.11720052,-0.14486712,0.0044207787,-0.18652701,0.41235626,-0.014599718,-0.09394027,0.10974099,-0.128537,0.019935384,-0.043219313,-0.14215872,0.0014872849,-0.29550317,-0.20460252,-0.09183985,0.3769994,0.21791337,0.020310149,0.41188538,-0.0974292,-0.25208068,0.073853955,0.1443606,0.12964721,-0.15087488,0.006344855,-0.19277905,0.04413956,0.2747525,0.33337298,0.08308331,0.17819215,-0.034776524,0.045737244,-0.08344264,0.13683319,0.03762663,-0.24967462,-0.05154867,0.26299006,-0.114629224,-0.024955776,0.030124143,-0.07201986,-0.08781624,0.029397335,0.115503654,-0.078204826,0.21208882,0.0018516183,-0.013392863,-0.29030323,-0.061553642,-0.10177219,-0.1835939,0.12198671,-0.3529244,0.23312192,-0.0750861,0.062312394,0.12523551,-0.08520821,-0.021698996,0.17067136,0.0039800825,-0.111841865,0.04477264,0.0010257587,0.09195647,-0.04971905,-0.01947023,-0.20370817,-0.070090204

9407119,1994,"Coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro and Kac-Moody algebras provide geometric
actions for matter coupled to gravity and gauge fields in two dimensions.
However, the Gauss' law constraints that arise from these actions are not
necessarily endemic to two-dimensional topologies. Indeed the constraints
associated with Yang-Mills naturally arise from the coadjoint orbit
construction of the WZW model. One may in fact use a Yang-Mills theory to
provide dynamics to the otherwise fixed coadjoint vectors that define the
orbits. In this letter we would like to exhibit an analogue of the Yang-Mills
classical action for the diffeomorphism sector. With this analogue one may
postulate a 4D theory of gravitation that is related to an underlying two
dimensional theory. Instead of quadratic differentials, a (1,3) pseudo tensor
becomes the dynamical variable. We briefly discuss how this tensor may be
classically coupled to matter.",0.123529136,0.20741597,-0.21843888,-0.2486008,-0.16100334,0.25955868,0.15212426,-0.6226271,0.07454295,0.1294005,-0.24742989,-0.25046462,-0.0952732,-0.27307373,0.06546223,0.10674689,0.1552505,0.07660604,0.09449437,-0.03086923,-0.19491272,0.15044549,-0.062441826,-0.40534344,-0.20089753,0.3281803,0.15930402,0.10941143,0.40153444,0.017834902,0.22093183,-0.23556824,0.08599476,0.18212715,0.28109267,0.24901198,-0.057407826,0.0104597695,0.05826121,-0.064492255,-0.24799936,-0.33942437,-0.18989103,-0.08587906,-0.22076565,0.021769388,0.44972864,-0.12084843,0.06253751,0.25395298,0.02538298,-0.08619918,0.16198641,0.05656998,0.31089288,-0.099190354,-0.15381469,-0.25553268,0.25661322,0.17669244,0.1804104,0.2379512,0.03612516,0.023595884,-0.004772395,0.2812259,-0.015427612,-0.2894477,-0.11955402,-0.2817607,0.2664131,-0.08193675,0.1718882,0.061680596,0.05806358,-0.062217444,0.26901034,0.014181033,0.025811471,0.036554586,-0.22052908,-0.11205835,0.041645873,-0.029309064,0.009259149,0.069201216,-0.066266164,0.23577473,-0.12288891,-0.07674278,-0.0642812,-0.23301138,-0.012349423,0.18880382,-0.20441552,0.25099874,-0.31700486,-0.30353212,0.020484887,-0.035577007,0.13602711,0.26827967,0.24243625,0.18720326,0.14325246,-0.20282266,-0.22341703,-0.2436046,0.37404412,-0.113532126,0.16761336,-0.3009345,0.07257488,0.01706925,-0.14776944,0.3611127,-0.019124804,0.2684016,-0.23783186,0.088028386,0.27558956,-0.072958864,-0.1325742,-0.2578331,-0.2360443,0.01540041,0.16923417,-0.098112494
9905049,1999,"A new method is discussed which vastly simplifies one of the two integrals

9606132,1996,"This paper studies the one-loop effective action for Euclidean Maxwell theory
about flat four-space bounded by one three-sphere, or two concentric
three-spheres. The analysis relies on Faddeev-Popov formalism and
$\zeta$-function regularization, and the Lorentz gauge-averaging term is used
with magnetic boundary conditions. The contributions of transverse,
longitudinal and normal modes of the electromagnetic potential, jointly with
ghost modes, are derived in detail. The most difficult part of the analysis
consists in the eigenvalue condition given by the determinant of a $2 \times 2$
or $4 \times 4$ matrix for longitudinal and normal modes. It is shown that the
former splits into a sum of Dirichlet and Robin contributions, plus a simpler
term. This is the quantum cosmological case. In the latter case, however, when
magnetic boundary conditions are imposed on two bounding three-spheres, the
determinant is more involved. Nevertheless, it is evaluated explicitly as well.
The whole analysis provides the building block for studying the one-loop
effective action in covariant gauges, on manifolds with boundary. The final
result differs from the value obtained when only transverse modes are
quantized, or when noncovariant gauges are used.",-0.14437605,-0.28660926,0.084631845,0.23205546,-0.10931726,0.44229072,0.070595026,-0.1215042,0.331615,-0.049628645,0.010436624,-0.030236797,0.12251352,-0.16597484,0.05545397,-0.22591005,-0.16306381,0.2165387,-0.30104375,0.40255523,0.112049,-0.10371491,-0.16352426,-0.09470476,-0.4280001,0.40751138,-0.07112683,-0.2172662,0.10692079,-0.05412776,-0.110309415,0.020611912,-0.30230296,0.02728679,0.07527607,0.055703513,-0.17687586,-0.18991065,0.13178374,0.36522305,-0.35594678,0.0022511824,0.3199028,-0.52473104,0.26709333,0.08829494,0.010459363,0.015159049,-0.09034592,0.28023523,-0.022211794,-0.0065124854,0.16988994,-0.19029456,0.38163,0.04256542,0.090887494,-0.27454853,0.26949704,0.03664375,0.25033808,-0.10566084,0.09295027,-0.18466261,0.21969043,-0.2044728,0.12948735,-0.21203342,-0.34454268,-0.25128865,0.048698053,0.12262513,0.5382425,0.021586657,-0.044516873,0.13557445,0.09201464,0.12839724,-0.049637374,0.20476106,0.15533477,-0.08088889,-0.057613343,-0.054682568,0.41041958,0.18087691,-0.13918468,-0.26580465,0.2410188,-0.031927504,-0.19301653,0.12821421,0.28891155,-0.08912425,0.10553799,0.039145462,-0.096318185,0.16432065,-0.33266318,0.050123304,0.099233,0.09282988,-0.26521623,-0.14743277,-0.1255096,-0.12465334,-0.33435807,0.13800523,0.01882121,0.04917171,0.2904668,-0.2937128,0.26819116,-0.40333754,-0.18867749,0.052879672,0.3735902,-5.7131052e-05,0.39552343,-0.12988865,-0.111288436,0.15450597,-0.38624886,0.15750769,0.14896123,-0.090223774,-0.005334571,-0.11091824
9903045,1999,"Within the context of a super-critical (Liouville) string, we discuss
(target-space) two-dimensional string cosmology. A numerical analysis indicates
that the identification of time with the Liouville mode results in an expanding
universe with matter which exhibits an inflationary phase, and `graceful exit'
from it, tending asymptotically to a flat-metric fixed point.This fixed point
is characterized by a dilaton configuration which, depending on the initial
conditions, either decreases linearly with the cosmic time, or is a finite
constant. This implies that, in contrast to the critical string case, the
string coupling remains bounded during the exit from the inflationary phase,
and, thus, the pertinent dynamics can be reliably described in terms of a
tree-level string effective action. The r\^ole of matter in inducing such
phenomena is emphasized. It is also interesting to note that the asymptotic
value of the vacuum energy, which in the $\sigma$-model framework is identified
with the `running' central charge deficit, depends crucially on the set of
initial conditions. Thus, although preliminary, this toy model seems to share
all the features expected to characterize a phenomenologically acceptable
cosmological string model.",-0.20873317,0.029865673,-0.07518315,-0.15304163,-0.165197,-0.49457547,-0.049426343,-0.16176249,-0.07205687,0.2862292,-0.26855177,-0.45902106,0.20515805,-0.055039763,0.0024009496,-0.07931972,-0.14814922,0.040392548,-0.17114909,-0.37640166,0.039734364,0.39238614,0.15392312,0.052253485,-0.058620125,0.21236238,-0.3803507,-0.18322861,-0.03343574,-0.13161075,-0.050206095,-0.1221075,-0.06976514,-0.18124156,0.07794154,0.29927957,0.09251641,0.23516281,-0.08078034,0.20857075,0.01221925,-0.19264932,0.20097612,-0.006621048,0.16033803,0.38173896,0.17651339,0.070945695,0.32766056,-0.003519386,-0.05443482,-0.02924461,0.01169686,-0.13310948,-0.24097073,-0.29910386,-0.34182099,0.004879594,0.2591438,0.20009466,0.2849362,0.09847425,-0.0494399,-0.20252138,0.13700438,0.10122202,-0.2280853,0.30723834,-0.13838434,0.16478634,-0.14828658,0.1496268,-0.06880322,-0.20925534,0.098088734,0.012868039,0.010442615,-0.004322216,0.11731925,-0.014861591,-0.42154914,-0.37462226,0.21478039,0.1975666,0.24037883,-0.20001903,0.049684875,-0.065455884,0.14042816,0.32872498,0.21389434,-0.031498224,-0.0019186884,-0.26852205,0.18288803,-0.03825167,0.23780629,0.046542868,-0.4470292,-0.09871116,0.12813067,0.030067816,0.045001008,-0.18598574,-0.07089083,0.18253493,-0.20221461,-0.177103,-0.15927173,-0.28279343,0.3417541,-0.1404101,0.13781798,-0.024694473,0.11051907,0.092303365,0.110233374,-0.038039416,-0.29633394,-0.32132572,0.06315872,-0.2788294,-0.07045242,-0.28662235,-0.07004015,-0.08037654,-0.20414805,0.06569612

9307148,1993,"A Wilson loop is defined, in 4-D pure Einstein gravity, as the trace of the
holonomy of the Christoffel connection or of the spin connection, and its
invariance under the symmetry transformations of the action is showed
(diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations). We then compute the loop
perturbatively, both on a flat background and in the presence of an external

the action of ``stabilized'' gravity. A geometrical analysis of the results in
terms of the gauge group of the euclidean theory, $SO(4)$, leads us to the
conclusion that the correspondent statistical system does not develope any
configuration with localized curvature at low temperature. This ``non-local''
behavior of the quantized gravitational field strongly contrasts with that of
usual gauge fields. Our results also provide an explanation for the absence of

9303103,1993,"A derivation of the Hawking effect is given which avoids reference to field
modes above some cutoff frequency $\omega_c\gg M^{-1}$ in the free-fall frame
of the black hole. To avoid reference to arbitrarily high frequencies, it is
necessary to impose a boundary condition on the quantum field in a timelike
region near the horizon, rather than on a (spacelike) Cauchy surface either
outside the horizon or at early times before the horizon forms. Due to the
nature of the horizon as an infinite redshift surface, the correct boundary
condition at late times outside the horizon cannot be deduced, within the
confines of a theory that applies only below the cutoff, from initial
conditions prior to the formation of the hole. A boundary condition is
formulated which leads to the Hawking effect in a cutoff theory. It is argued
that it is possible the boundary condition is {\it not} satisfied, so that the
spectrum of black hole radiation may be significantly different from that
predicted by Hawking, even without the back-reaction near the horizon becoming
of order unity relative to the curvature.",-0.06202872,-0.016190484,0.0069534564,0.15938172,-0.22090642,0.17720994,-0.06426054,-0.17331716,-0.09786435,0.27338067,-0.123502366,-0.21877001,0.13825448,-0.03646396,-0.09913266,0.06024465,-0.0718099,0.09451932,0.32999125,-0.14310244,-0.22129259,0.04231444,-0.005632546,-0.0980216,0.0688054,0.05952728,-0.15106371,-0.25644264,-0.117335275,-0.056006923,0.07761623,-0.01914562,-0.036556378,-0.08178999,-0.13697414,-0.18592292,-0.020701908,0.03275335,-0.07505527,0.004460804,-0.2840138,-0.015574951,-0.13633248,0.03384261,-0.10048878,-0.0073061287,0.022128642,-0.15180373,0.019777127,0.1565067,-0.104021415,-0.113842614,-0.25364345,-0.34304982,0.15832098,-0.033533365,-0.031431377,-0.4451803,0.05087325,-0.1474593,-0.05359994,0.12009198,0.03192452,0.08608106,-0.16686417,0.011295745,-0.14153998,-0.28172186,-0.03424169,-0.15799719,0.09048793,0.2282046,0.21713793,0.05068168,-0.049231343,0.05714594,-0.13337815,0.0685181,-0.18137047,-0.05832603,-0.17592156,0.021776965,0.12401219,0.11756756,0.33030957,0.031677857,0.019961424,-0.17344724,0.05651027,0.14180543,-0.106571175,0.31279016,-0.232969,-0.037511863,-0.14663184,-0.020677084,0.057640042,-0.040238783,-0.005274199,-0.012118317,-0.0131675005,0.16868511,-0.11205899,-0.11116929,-0.0751424,0.1452708,0.07776877,-0.047107764,-0.074623786,-0.079146385,0.16852045,0.08015407,0.1732544,0.12554985,-0.09993589,-0.15561828,0.035936095,0.18389064,-0.2653411,-0.056438804,-0.07448003,0.046371527,-0.005953908,-0.08017434,-0.25407737,0.22091286,0.13530654,0.008141339
9801124,1998,"We project the Wilson/Polchinski renormalization group equation onto its
uniform external field dependent effective free energy and connected Green's
functions. The result is a hierarchy of equations which admits a choice of
""natural"" truncation and closure schemes for nonperturbative approximate
solution. In this way approximation schemes can be generated which avoid power
series expansions in either fields or momenta. When following one closure
scheme the lowest order equation is the mean field approximation, while another
closure scheme gives the ""local potential approximation."" Extension of these
closure schemes to higher orders leads to interesting new questions regarding
truncation schemes and the convergence of nonperturbative approximations. One

9306136,1993,"We analyze the subdivision properties of certain lattice gauge theories for
the discrete abelian groups $Z_{p}$, in four dimensions. In these particular
models we show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under all $(k,l)$
subdivision moves, when the coupling scale is a $p$th root of unity. For the
case of manifolds with boundary, we demonstrate analytically that Alexander
type $2$ and $3$ subdivision of a bounding simplex is equivalent to the
insertion of an operator which equals a delta function on trivial bounding
holonomies. The four dimensional model then gives rise to an effective gauge
invariant three dimensional model on its boundary, and we compute the
combinatorially invariant value of the partition function for the case of
$S^{3}$ and $S^{2}\times S^{1}$.",0.23856442,-0.12492533,0.023794878,0.1566746,0.13258718,-0.26787364,0.23388442,0.0758129,0.039079502,-0.03926245,0.16353014,0.03629726,0.046948,0.19130597,0.10214537,-0.054915447,-0.1275528,-0.103543326,0.058895767,0.104678296,-0.17406943,-0.057440322,0.18078618,0.1327947,-0.042933226,-0.17234263,-0.03646659,-0.13254449,-0.016807636,-0.033528037,-0.08535406,0.09096879,-0.08888313,0.13441384,-0.121764004,0.22116482,0.1275492,-0.13429955,-0.07804878,-0.16627502,0.062818885,0.20428085,-0.038908057,-0.19825995,-0.22216177,-0.090446815,-0.12531278,0.001962915,0.084266275,-0.1479801,0.124469124,-0.09280544,0.14495786,-0.09112279,0.23448077,0.083966896,0.019301215,0.10527393,-0.143336,0.1797111,0.10756026,0.012442589,0.08384233,-0.2805784,-0.027250372,0.13705857,0.1324935,-0.09888829,-0.080544606,0.14408952,-0.09449752,-0.15457371,-0.18087476,-0.102807514,0.14139672,0.22183342,0.020256598,0.053847533,-0.30296028,-0.18752736,-0.16449973,0.09873436,-0.025071729,-0.17557956,-0.2198963,-0.29586744,-0.2648033,-0.042403053,-0.022759847,-0.0036172308,-0.07476827,0.16351895,0.13368973,-0.2610929,0.029349666,0.15598795,-0.34475887,0.16550474,-0.0077842344,0.20821372,-0.057810534,-0.23671946,-0.2001917,0.0013073757,-0.08454448,0.22973369,0.3357172,-0.021613099,-0.12223196,0.0873321,-0.3243311,-0.06486261,-0.19527207,-0.07300219,0.07294865,0.1468603,0.058466434,-0.15490903,0.049849078,0.009741195,0.1688968,0.0013130307,-0.14536572,0.020629685,0.24351788,-0.09033882,-0.27983007,0.119128495

9706165,1997,"It has been shown recently that the toroidally compactified type IIB string
effective action possesses an SL(2, R) invariance. Using this symmetry we
construct an infinite family of macroscopic string-like solutions permuted by
SL(2, Z) group for type II superstrings in $4 \leq D < 10$. These solutions,
which formally look very similar to the corresponding solutions in $D = 10$,
are characterized by two relatively prime integers corresponding to the

T-duality do receive, in general, quantum corrections. It is interesting to
check whether classical T-duality can be exact as a quantum symmetry. The
natural starting point is a $\sigma$-model with N=4 world sheet supersymmetry.
Remarkably, we find that (owing to the fact that N=4 models with torsion are
not off-shell finite as quantum theories),the T-duality transformations for
these models get in general quantum corrections, with the only known exception

9510058,1995,"We argue that the gauge-fermion interaction in multiflavour quantum
electrodynamics in $(2 + 1)$-dimensions is responsible for non-fermi liquid
behaviour in the infrared, in the sense of leading to the existence of a
non-trivial (quasi) fixed point that lies between the trivial fixed point (at
infinite momenta) and the region where dynamical symmetry breaking and mass
generation occurs. This quasi-fixed point structure implies slowly varying,
rather than fixed, couplings in the intermediate regime of momenta, a situation
which resembles that of (four-dimensional) `walking technicolour' models of
particle physics. The inclusion of wave-function renormalization yields
marginal $O(1/N)$-corrections to the `bulk' non-fermi liquid behaviour caused
by the gauge interaction in the limit of infinite flavour number. Such
corrections lead to the appearance of modified critical exponents. In
particular, at low temperatures there appear to be logarithmic scaling
violations of the linear resistivity of the system of order $O(1/N)$.
Connection with the anomalous normal-state properties of certain condensed
matter systems relevant for high-temperature superconductivity is briefly
discussed. The relevance of the large (flavour) $N$ expansion to the
fermi-liquid problem is emphasized. As a partial result of our analysis, we
point out the absence of Charge-Density-Wave Instabilities from the effective
low-energy theory, as a consequence of gauge invariance.",-0.010921621,0.14504689,-0.14529121,-0.101310596,-0.026000334,-0.289818,-0.1736628,0.059791736,0.043832205,-0.1033933,0.0045151114,-0.057138804,0.04241085,0.11044315,-0.099272974,0.009479247,0.24222274,0.34233826,0.053875986,0.19393703,0.0075666457,-0.24260835,-0.17596456,0.117782995,-0.033505388,0.05086175,-0.05383665,-0.08932317,0.17473856,-0.23336518,0.0349517,-0.090015456,0.12471411,-0.12757704,0.0034091398,0.07626083,0.23161954,-0.05860237,0.09027664,0.025118317,0.055733975,0.14386202,0.03816892,0.22388864,-0.123238176,0.050497066,-0.2013829,-0.15557177,0.1107044,-0.009005722,-0.22039247,0.09043416,0.23588865,0.11628252,0.17672841,0.113660485,-0.06261408,0.17759086,-0.21893027,-0.17397833,-0.091500126,-0.04278891,0.055762414,-0.004510358,0.10128079,0.031481646,-0.06584802,0.06349297,-0.051959697,0.13162439,0.06661835,0.027598884,-0.11262513,0.05703048,-0.073409915,0.24080393,-0.033072725,-0.015798084,-0.039986327,-0.313684,0.06932898,-0.21334098,0.010790259,0.12295425,-0.014692474,0.21968976,-0.13093282,-0.09094562,-0.0363335,0.11442828,-0.03755632,-0.054388817,0.008832533,-0.028154854,0.016760532,0.21216586,-0.08493599,0.038554683,0.07196367,0.05109108,-0.019925805,0.053442493,-0.13156891,0.078407794,0.06829533,-0.07721964,0.051241357,-0.15308797,-0.029258074,0.1707449,0.15693535,0.21527861,-0.21249191,0.24224047,0.03816206,0.17552519,-0.024809238,-0.25859132,-0.04670159,0.0040361937,-0.22105226,-0.010306306,-0.010925658,0.14964633,-0.054231424,-0.056049168,0.03358806,0.17027824

9902156,1999,"We discuss the entropy for the extremal BTZ black hole and the extremal EBTZ
black hole. The EBTZ black hole means the BTZ black hole embedded in a
five-dimensional(5D) black hole. The six-dimensional(6D) black string with
traveling waves is introduced as a concrete model for realizing the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The traveling waves carry the momentum distribution $p(u)$

9509017,1995,"Exact Superstring solutions are constructed moving in 4-D space-time with
positive curvature and non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. The
full spectrum of string excitations is derived as a function of moduli fields
$T^{i}$ and the scale $\mu^2=1/(k+2)$ which induced by the non-zero background
fields. The spectrum of string excitations has a non-zero mass gap $\mu^2$ and
in the weak curvature limit ($\mu$ small) $\mu^2$ plays the role of a well
defined infrared regulator, consistent with modular invariance, gauge
invariance, supersymmetry and chirality.
 The effects of a covariantly constant chomo-magnetic field $B$ as well as
additional curvature can be derived exactly up to one string-loop level. Thus,
the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational, gauge and Yukawas)
are unambiguously computed and are finite both in the Ultra-Violet and the
Infra-Red regime. These corrections are necessary for quantitative string
superunification predictions at low energies. Similar calculations are done in
the effective field theory. The one-loop corrections to the couplings are also
found to satisfy Infrared Flow Equations.",-0.061426774,-0.17174324,0.1236813,-0.3593324,-0.11915097,-0.08133802,-0.25959653,0.14573374,0.21871254,0.2376608,-0.07385248,0.24103819,-0.10008265,-0.11056807,0.027478207,-0.09461253,-0.05528568,0.18273313,-0.020199472,0.05854122,0.084192716,0.30946508,0.14374311,0.16239503,-0.09806621,0.038419105,0.09359412,-0.057025023,0.119839795,-0.18070534,0.031886503,-0.035432946,0.013947517,0.20180085,0.23643093,0.10208247,-0.15892234,-0.148178,-0.11868485,0.09242401,-0.23918815,-0.06099502,-0.09792129,0.04966842,0.06530994,0.138854,-0.08680627,-0.10689502,-0.04502487,0.28627428,-0.06299423,-0.123696,-0.1282469,0.054123,0.103868835,0.0017517507,-0.069679976,0.0073904097,0.29440856,0.14907163,0.017346531,0.41239107,0.092046365,-0.10962811,-0.053958938,0.29148567,-0.084370896,-0.22476417,-0.20869446,-0.14299087,0.09459189,0.040810674,-0.008327767,0.37005144,0.18996035,-0.20541777,0.0709174,0.08977415,0.064116016,0.048303477,-0.0062217563,-0.114502564,0.03155992,0.102975115,0.13794221,0.17494701,0.10389146,0.06862757,-0.18300538,0.17447405,0.104783505,0.01093702,-0.24004962,0.03927883,-0.03277012,-0.16282538,-0.06669852,0.07413919,-0.068875685,-0.07536551,-0.14117716,0.47921318,0.14754671,-0.029122688,-0.002282016,-0.12730381,-0.10940317,0.079298116,0.005463708,-0.09661418,-0.029181108,-0.122116365,0.18216258,-0.15033722,-0.015028387,0.12485043,0.055012517,0.14454265,-0.0053705275,-0.17216948,-0.20744255,0.30472878,0.26694772,-0.12732817,-0.13767566,-0.1849908,-0.19973576,-0.17565233
9804121,1998,"In this paper we use the matrix string approach to begin a study of high
energy scattering processes in M-theory. In particular we exhibit an
instanton-type configuration in 1+1 super-Yang-Mills theory that can be
interpreted as a non-perturbative description of a string interaction. This
solution is used to describe high energy processes with non-zero longitudinal
momentum exchange, in which an arbitrary number of eigenvalues get transferred
between the two scattering states. We describe a direct correspondence between
these semi-classical SYM configurations and the Gross-Mende saddle points. We
also study in detail the pair production of D-particles via a one-loop
calculation which in the 1+1D gauge theory language is described by the

9501118,1995,"The QED(0+1) model describing a quantum mechanical particle on a circle with
minimal electromagnetic interaction and with a potential -M cos(phi - theta_M),
which mimics the massive Schwinger model, is discussed as a prototype of
mechanisms and infrared structures of gauge quantum field theories in positive
gauges. The functional integral representation displays a complex measure, with
a crucial role of the boundary conditions, and the decomposition into theta
sectors takes place already in finite volume. In the infinite volume limit, the
standard results are reproduced for M=0 (massless fermions), but one meets
substantial differences for M not = 0: for generic boundary conditions,
independently of the lagrangean angle of the topological term, the infinite
volume limit selects the sector with theta = theta_M, and provides a natural
""dynamical"" solution of the strong CP problem. In comparison with previous
approaches, the strategy discussed here allows to exploit the consequences of
the theta-dependence of the free energy density, with a unique minimum at theta

at arbitrary level in terms of vertex operators. The string model describes a
completely compactified subcritical chiral bosonic string whose momentum
lattice is taken to be the (Lorentzian) affine weight lattice. The main feature
of the new realization is the replacement of the ordinary string oscillators by
physical DDF operators, whereas the unphysical position operators are
substituted by certain linear combinations of the Lorentz generators. As a side
result we obtain simple expressions for the affine Weyl translations as Lorentz
boosts.

9910060,1999,"I discuss some issues of perturbative quantum gravity, namely of a theory of
self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge fields, the gravitons, on flat
space-time, in the framework of causal perturbation theory. The central aspects
of this approach lie in the construction of the scattering matrix by means of
causality and Poincare covariance and in the analysis of the gauge structure of
the theory. For this purpose, two main tools will be used: the Epstein-Glaser
inductive and causal construction of the perturbation series for the scattering
matrix and the concept of perturbative operator quantum gauge invariance
borrowed from non-Abelian quantum gauge theories. The first method deals with
the ultraviolet problem of quantum gravity and the second one ensures gauge
invariance at the quantum level, formulated by means of a gauge charge, in each
order of perturbation theory. The gauge charge leads to a characterization of
the physical subspace of the graviton Fock space. Aspects of quantum gravity
coupled to scalar matter fields are also discussed.",0.063319325,0.057604335,-0.07353452,-0.062754095,-0.284505,0.10637578,0.1413421,-0.0945337,0.23824602,-0.04146868,0.04589909,0.024342488,0.20780325,0.020539403,0.10654502,0.13922411,-0.11429767,-0.07789654,-0.17864645,-0.1943419,-0.08131489,0.10028897,-0.14968932,0.13617903,-0.09144072,-0.024873763,0.20083426,0.017259374,0.18138307,0.03284335,0.012827903,0.09536178,-0.30245736,0.08132957,0.21619865,-0.17301273,-0.029917046,-0.015212432,0.15929392,0.013491889,0.2332326,-0.09539717,-0.07621733,0.037047006,-0.08061653,-0.1774691,0.105622366,-0.10336903,0.26738808,-0.12953812,-0.060462672,0.13696876,0.005577281,0.1448731,-0.007373292,-0.3342168,-0.33623105,-0.21072087,0.021184325,0.29812908,-0.11671239,-0.101105034,0.12995064,-0.0633979,0.033852495,-0.20272721,0.07114118,0.16130112,-0.078702904,-0.2587782,0.14135653,0.037433654,0.26757747,-0.11124013,0.10089226,-0.20523617,-0.29582834,-0.12969325,0.18349439,0.14300612,0.16911957,0.067919105,-0.09188059,0.5333516,-0.006945491,0.13300267,0.19547504,0.23958139,0.24516839,-0.1674562,0.13902014,0.15237622,0.2534839,0.25018823,0.12666376,-0.21712932,0.23135921,-0.1961674,0.45557103,-0.10926065,0.035160936,-0.06122136,0.13792151,0.16527906,-0.08386235,-0.17604744,-0.20012558,0.027290791,-0.1526864,-0.03860791,0.02604618,-0.11946225,0.021497741,-0.33497962,-0.38484392,-0.08188346,-0.2337293,0.23952493,0.092754826,-0.30554625,0.08027717,0.2741478,-0.036595188,0.017193615,-0.12735005,0.09996299,0.24104512,0.18906544

9908036,1999,"We develop further the theory of Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) on
a cylinder with specified boundary conditions emphasizing the role of a triplet
of algebras: the Verlinde, graph fusion and Pasquier algebras. We show that
solving Cardy's equation, expressing consistency of a RCFT on a cylinder, is
equivalent to finding integer valued matrix representations of the Verlinde
algebra. These matrices allow us to naturally associate a graph $G$ to each
RCFT such that the conformal boundary conditions are labelled by the nodes of
$G$. This approach is carried to completion for $sl(2)$ theories leading to
complete sets of conformal boundary conditions, their associated cylinder
partition functions and the $A$-$D$-$E$ classification. We also review the
current status for WZW $sl(3)$ theories. Finally, a systematic generalization
of the formalism of Cardy-Lewellen is developed to allow for multiplicities

9512215,1995,"The BRST quantization of a gauge theory in noncommutative geometry is carried
out in the ``matrix derivative"" approach. BRST/anti-BRST transformation rules
are obtained by applying the horizontality condition, in the superconnection
formalism. A BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action is then constructed, using
an adaptation of the method devised by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg for the
Yang-Mills case. The resulting quantum action turns out to be the same as that
of a gauge theory in the 't Hooft gauge with spontaneously broken symmetry. Our
result shows that only the even part of the supergroup acts as a gauge
symmetry, while the odd part effectively provides a global symmetry. We treat

9903111,1999,"We present the algebraic framework for the quantization of the classical
bosonic charge algebra of maximally extended (N=16) supergravity in two
dimensions, thereby taking the first steps towards an exact quantization of
this model. At the core of our construction is the Yangian algebra $Y(e_8)$
whose RTT presentation we discuss in detail. The full symmetry algebra is a
centrally extended twisted version of the Yangian double $DY(e_8)_c$. We show
that there exists only one special value of the central charge for which the
quantum algebra admits an ideal by which the algebra can be divided so as to
consistently reproduce the classical coset structure $E_{8(8)}/SO(16)$ in the
limit $\hbar\to 0$.",-0.03160747,-0.15118858,0.07627265,0.16780356,-0.22243401,-0.21419123,0.064831555,-0.035342827,-0.11451177,0.05944659,0.038624547,-0.011367992,-0.09502584,-0.26125354,0.13209617,0.003964253,-0.08906244,0.09570482,-0.07002728,-0.25272894,-0.013238221,0.14508207,-0.023136772,-0.043021306,0.08888653,-0.030752202,0.2741717,-0.24817546,0.09708306,0.08099871,-0.007826403,-0.11426802,-0.15972522,0.24793984,-0.06827696,-0.21189338,-0.03724847,-0.02348566,-0.14913183,0.22192562,-0.15975878,-0.26910758,-0.11947511,-0.071353525,-0.4866258,-0.10080902,0.17343932,-0.34040713,0.31625974,0.19672081,0.0022507831,-0.061614413,0.19280796,0.019268863,0.10457057,-0.20267594,-0.21002899,0.05397612,0.19713268,0.20074734,0.4205512,-0.03827849,-0.10756303,-0.13656998,0.09800842,0.4022376,0.04199662,-0.059990376,0.012547381,-0.11573757,-0.09948295,-0.03668213,0.087358624,0.10933842,-0.08822447,-0.03868984,-0.02502741,0.06482294,0.15601659,-0.21472576,0.026553363,0.11501819,-0.047022488,-0.09849994,0.26224083,0.263883,0.14230688,0.120754845,0.09756844,-0.14913575,0.17892756,-0.0075360094,-0.106396556,0.06195046,0.30803663,-0.20538554,-0.088496774,-0.25574896,0.09744909,-0.22977011,0.045383193,0.11702732,0.061863378,0.016954008,0.11887828,-0.2972313,-0.3104663,0.06343461,0.041777883,-0.036449835,-0.063793086,0.1376928,0.15829554,0.061822176,-0.07207109,-0.15398332,-0.11778579,0.19399628,0.06271385,-0.08198633,-0.05288284,0.08932651,-0.082802,-0.26914957,-0.29312503,0.12963249,0.0776353,-0.23768887
9312007,1993,"We argue that theories with fundamental fermions which undergo chiral
symmetry breaking have several universal features which are qualitatively
different than those of theories with fundamental scalars. Several bounds on
the critical indices $\delta$ and $\eta$ follow. We observe that in four
dimensions the logarithmic scaling violations enter into the Equation of State
of scalar theories, such as $\lambda\phi^4$, and fermionic models, such as
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio, in qualitatively different ways. These observations lead to
useful approaches for analyzing lattice simulations of a wide class of model
field theories. Our results imply that $\lambda\phi^4$ {\it cannot} be a good
guide to understanding the possible triviality of spinor $QED$.",-0.096174926,-0.14851013,-0.17337766,0.22956249,-0.111922756,0.26237297,0.17736079,-0.23578808,0.07392704,-0.20058315,-0.18062012,0.112263955,0.09988031,-0.05220649,0.12610142,0.20764977,0.25421733,-0.3655372,0.20233276,-0.0040813833,0.034966886,-0.2704503,-0.042635508,-0.04426883,-0.3036635,0.3756783,-0.16731776,0.006471023,0.2868722,0.40369403,0.15977748,0.10943924,-0.15660101,-0.034711517,-0.3805021,-0.08156687,-0.1585905,-0.10179357,0.1833412,0.31943202,0.06420551,0.01622856,-0.5064651,0.04270819,0.008017167,0.46389496,0.07254252,0.013892859,-0.14315394,0.33056206,0.31477937,0.060196757,0.060627423,-0.1331518,0.15438205,-0.14359954,-0.3742936,-0.43590978,-0.022333503,-0.03335002,0.14472096,0.0038464367,0.15517113,-0.3316738,0.19233668,0.014638051,0.15176614,-0.29157424,0.21273357,0.1920456,0.10588898,-0.26868513,-0.18322754,0.23645845,0.065213814,-0.12713625,-0.12517732,0.21078971,-0.06825963,0.12970737,-0.5758139,-0.16624849,0.09860965,-0.05588778,0.21501233,-0.14085588,0.31692472,-0.0037812218,0.35630274,0.2155509,-0.06932129,-0.1906403,-0.036265105,-0.037335858,-0.124530494,-0.21078068,0.1181384,-0.19372815,0.21266156,-0.0983944,-0.085864775,0.008484185,0.23412362,-0.012201369,0.14800246,0.32909843,-0.28766328,0.017239295,0.03780681,-0.13317385,-0.031950753,-0.15776491,-0.2089177,0.108226776,0.25382766,-0.15643527,-0.11784491,-0.22567107,0.14319888,-0.0028986754,-0.13425347,-0.11406434,0.09021692,-0.6379132,-0.15313965,0.36206383,0.046045914,-0.14786777

9811089,1998,"D-branes, topological defects in string theory on which string endpoints can
live, may give new insight into the understanding of the cosmological evolution
of the Universe at early epochs. We analyze the dynamics of D-branes in curved
backgrounds and discuss the parameter space of M-theory as a function of the
coupling constant and of the curvature of the Universe. We show that D-branes
may be efficiently produced by gravitational effects. Furthermore, in curved
spacetimes the transverse fluctuations of the D-branes develop a tachyonic mode
and when the fluctuations grow larger than the horizon the branes become
tensionless and break up. This signals a transition to a new regime. We discuss
the implications of our findings for the singularity problem present in string
cosmology, suggesting the existence of a limiting value for the curvature which
is in agreement with the value suggested by the cosmological version of the
holography principle. We also comment on possible implications for the
so-called brane world scenario, where the Standard Model gauge and matter
fields live inside some branes while gravitons live in the bulk.",-0.13466759,-0.01801569,0.21737242,-0.15791878,0.084306076,-0.08770925,-0.0033890307,-0.029825985,-0.04226444,0.18525179,-0.22849569,0.053625338,-0.009661677,-0.056830704,-0.027414992,-0.2082635,-0.12555416,-0.1530959,-0.010496624,-0.14384204,-0.052843243,0.17753917,-0.09734624,0.07931218,0.00822334,0.032623474,-0.02652444,0.05110275,-0.13016379,-0.16675206,-0.16664195,-0.046736926,-0.0032917708,0.1320438,0.15290897,0.25666556,-0.51898944,0.03917502,-0.109201424,0.14386381,-0.02959758,-0.04027633,-0.06545311,0.01372112,-0.22990069,-0.08587395,0.22532529,-0.06850015,-0.11819705,-0.0015437305,-0.11444536,0.05710326,0.08172894,-0.043738566,-0.24529085,0.10601832,0.07831895,0.00631997,0.23648795,0.07824211,0.04158789,0.24251467,-0.24744876,0.29442555,0.16082132,0.15162885,0.11002621,0.16061048,-0.13991551,-0.055457845,0.015115619,0.067895085,0.12050671,-0.03629875,0.03484892,-0.04862324,0.13203122,-0.015457749,0.10871619,0.050740976,-0.18907307,0.2754633,0.07260425,-0.24426217,0.09245384,0.2023852,-0.054404326,0.14945807,-0.14360812,-0.063313514,0.046017326,0.0243785,0.046920806,0.119120754,-0.06572827,-0.03620802,-0.20365265,-0.45529106,-0.26694602,-0.16913767,-0.031057477,0.16993341,-0.017993405,-0.0054477677,0.07185583,0.17034051,-0.032992184,0.29301316,-0.016099319,-0.0640084,0.3830232,-0.07298469,0.07072495,-0.13341102,0.3125121,0.10419447,0.30568352,0.14356916,-0.14663483,0.011437325,-0.23027423,0.13416126,0.07702194,0.056424294,-0.11652723,-0.36208004,-0.06566558,-0.23781763

9312067,1993,"We point out that in a recent paper by Chaichian et al. (Phys.
Rev.Lett71(1993)3405) Dirac quantization procedure is not properly followed as
a result of which the resulting quantum theory is different from what one will
get by a straightforward application of Dirac's formulation. For example at
quantum level the model in I has noncommutative geometry, i.e., $[x_\mu, x_\nu]
\neq 0$ while a correct treatment would give $[x_\mu, x_\nu] = 0$. Moreover,

reviewed. In particular, the charged-particle pair production rate in an

massless Dirac fermions with a non-local 4-point interaction coupled to a
U(1)-gauge field. The complete solution of the model is found using the

invariant Green functions is provided. We discuss the role of anomalies and
show how the existence of large gauge transformations implies a fermion

9804067,1998,"Polchinski and Pouliot have shown that M-momentum transfer between membranes
in supergravity can be understood as a non-perturbative instanton effect in
gauge theory. Here we consider a dual process: electric flux transmission
between D-branes. We show that this process can be described in perturbation
theory as virtual string pair creation, and is closely related to Schwinger's
treatment of the pair creation of charged particles in a uniform electric
field. Through the application of dualities, our perturbative calculation gives
results for various non-perturbative amplitudes, including M-momentum transfer
between gravitons, membranes, and longitudinal fivebranes. Thus perturbation
theory plus dualities are sufficient to demonstrate agreement between
supergravity and gauge theory for a number of M-momentum transferring
processes. A variety of other processes where branes are transmitted between
branes, e.g. (p,q)-string transmission in IIB-theory, can also be studied. We
discuss the implications of our results for proving the 11 dimensional Lorentz
invariance of Matrix theory.",0.11731288,0.10642101,-0.1310999,-0.40411085,-0.3096602,0.30519372,-0.24389154,-0.3030098,0.13284199,0.17601207,-0.050373033,-0.13991092,0.060028687,-0.18027014,-0.34880984,0.12593313,-0.21385345,-0.18333277,-0.107712895,0.11208735,-0.1593709,0.2943956,0.025402013,-0.083613634,-0.22859937,0.158016,0.16921198,-0.18170336,0.6239238,-0.19740579,0.06427571,-0.24250925,-0.0018642098,-0.25400466,0.19701369,0.04581067,-0.091755375,-0.031533062,-0.18412228,0.13830929,0.21944976,-0.044303924,-0.043292165,0.017855324,0.34162688,0.1167182,0.33815753,0.45017815,0.17475063,0.16477111,-0.3709489,0.16636807,0.16297598,-0.07334873,-0.15911917,-0.54104203,-0.20751312,-0.017576247,0.24920085,-0.0007761121,0.3200479,-0.060366705,0.22419569,-0.031382374,0.12058997,0.049386993,-0.17164806,-0.011304237,-0.12958677,-0.20816955,-0.07208575,0.18295076,0.045859724,-0.13604832,0.38561615,-0.12356992,-0.15015316,0.11425629,0.06307626,0.17744796,-0.17317188,-0.23964109,0.16040546,0.21700326,0.24148779,0.2789566,-0.047905438,-0.39127862,0.09869675,-0.017401613,0.09290557,-0.09601511,-0.047664598,0.06591478,0.01135826,0.2636874,-0.13704942,0.040147603,-0.07011551,-0.28399116,0.14774022,0.13520852,0.17736188,0.13067207,0.14033845,-0.23012799,-0.26590005,-0.23975074,0.21440203,-0.055880934,-0.081735075,-0.19231467,0.24940452,-0.16053863,0.034117054,0.24673915,-0.1698393,-0.071677715,-0.22467002,-0.027922012,-0.04620801,0.045584142,-0.377489,-0.2537296,-0.16424643,-0.0171403,0.32849565,-0.05793474
9403135,1994,"In this paper we study integrability and algebraic integrability properties
of certain matrix Schr\""odinger operators. More specifically, we associate such
an operator (with rational, trigonometric, or elliptic coefficients) to every
simple Lie algebra g and every representation U of this algebra with a nonzero
but finite dimensional zero weight subspace. The Calogero-Sutherland operator
is a special case of this construction. Such an operator is always integrable.
Our main result is that it is also algebraically integrable in the rational and
trigonometric case if the representation U is highest weight. This generalizes
the corresponding result for Calogero-Sutherland operators proved by Chalyh and
Vaselov. We also conjecture that this is true for the elliptic case as well,
which is a generalization of the corresponding conjecture by Chalyh and Vaselov

9210113,1992,"We analyze some features of the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons
theory (CST) in the Landau gauge. In this gauge the theory is known to be
perturbatively finite. We consider the renormalization scheme in which the
renormalized parameter $k$ equals the bare or classical one and show that it
constitutes a natural parametrization for the quantum theory. The reason is
that, although in this renormalization scheme the value of the Green functions
depends on the regularization used, comparison among different regularization
methods shows that the observables (Wilson loops) are the same function of the
shifted monodromy parameter $k+c_v$ for all BRS invariant regulators used so
far for CST. We also discuss a particular BRS invariant regularization
prescription in which CST is perturbatively defined as the large mass limit of
dimensionally regularized topologically massive Yang-Mills theory. With this
regularization prescription the radiative corrections induced by two-loop
contributions do not entail observable consequences since they can be
reabsorbed by a finite rescaling of the fields only. This very mechanism is

9704084,1997,"We solve the Cauchy problem for the relativistic closed string in Minkowski
space $M^{3+1}$, including the cases where the initial data has a knot like
topology. We give the general conditions for the world sheet of a closed
knotted string to be a time periodic surface. In the particular case of zero
initial string velocity the period of the world sheet is proportional to half
the length ($\ell$) of the initial string and a knotted string always collapses
to a link for $t=\ell/4$. Relativistic closed strings are dynamically evolving
or pulsating structures in spacetime, and knotted or unknotted like structures
remain stable over time. The generation of arbitrary $n$-fold knots, starting
with an initial simple link configuration with non zero velocity is possible.",-0.093006805,-0.28181523,0.23014829,-0.032387972,-0.25876582,0.28988615,-0.12892494,-0.22733723,-0.25191003,0.2735923,0.08897097,0.035881728,-0.04544467,0.06695461,-0.13053894,0.31561524,0.078245714,0.16213949,0.2285324,-0.25479412,0.5062966,0.21508646,0.34450394,-0.42508212,-0.1488927,-0.42588127,0.075199254,-0.33364177,0.04880999,-0.0154411495,0.17421494,0.019222848,0.31666645,0.068052,-0.7156189,0.24077316,-0.2758157,0.0133072585,-0.35785535,-0.32675183,0.027880233,0.19160289,-0.31423187,0.34044808,0.21283701,-0.15359488,0.2815151,0.15021196,0.04711231,0.047979593,-0.09132391,-0.11169259,-0.18263192,-0.25847834,-0.19480148,-0.006486073,0.24205378,-0.2665618,0.107075244,-0.38986015,0.16327797,0.25550058,0.1580127,-0.05828146,0.17243509,-0.25539556,-0.30059952,-0.21083595,-0.039012194,0.081066385,-0.15169606,0.37813327,0.0008879304,-0.02697882,0.3730344,-0.18016435,-0.12621516,0.12319502,-0.053797863,-0.05871048,0.33972266,-0.24897107,0.100169,-0.3123875,0.081055924,0.3108312,0.06341555,-0.14292206,0.23408234,0.14230189,0.2585734,0.1646755,-0.03008243,-0.29242843,-0.040709063,0.155083,0.17691316,-0.055890203,0.072024524,0.0010381043,0.21000597,-0.10284379,0.13206491,0.1222757,0.26978013,0.00493747,0.20549126,-0.11171684,-0.065306455,0.26578462,0.13700467,-0.34567422,-0.20435762,-0.15137394,-0.0008017421,0.3502374,-0.010654313,0.115520716,-0.06483781,-0.23612529,-0.42636007,-0.06101469,-0.08380348,-0.11965528,-0.16675074,-0.07179196,-0.029586121,-0.025533706

9507138,1995,"Under general assumptions, we present a low-energy effective action for the
quantum Hall state when edges exist. It is shown that the chiral edge current
is necessary to make the effective action to be gauge invariant. However the
chiral edge current is irrelevant to the Hall current. The exactly quantized
value of $\sigma_{xy}$ is observed only when the Hall current does not flow at
the edge region. Our effective theory is applicable to the quantum Hall liquid
on a surface with non-trivial topology and physical meanings of the topology
are discussed.",-0.10520738,-0.15076727,0.1872349,0.04690407,0.16360952,-0.25046554,0.3538894,-0.23109518,0.033755362,0.020273974,0.0045420825,0.01184167,0.07501364,0.043101374,-0.17006035,0.107658714,0.21739283,-0.06074082,0.12745716,0.102718815,-0.11845781,-0.032087732,-0.07392716,-0.09812547,-0.040979333,0.019734038,0.06116458,-0.22328553,-0.122065656,0.100470126,-0.02598919,0.15641552,-0.06432259,-0.07059759,0.17351946,0.11288759,-0.17088538,-0.08205195,-0.39087752,-0.019537047,0.11499709,0.11885666,-0.11831471,0.03537354,-0.13432218,-0.08939773,-0.08558903,-0.03963876,-0.17708924,-0.072615206,0.09819434,0.061748754,0.04213369,0.030005172,-0.12688738,0.052360643,0.0731555,0.22568084,-0.16167104,0.0047476813,0.20114028,-0.0016318597,-0.0942294,0.13968559,-0.076842636,0.04428875,0.12902254,0.048967503,-0.0071755312,0.17873293,-0.115196556,-0.059915148,-0.09809186,0.042463735,-0.06787422,0.084130585,-0.062176242,-0.01677046,-0.09369713,-0.036415257,-0.13636026,0.13142027,0.14395231,-0.35705948,-0.21363664,0.29963696,-0.17185728,0.099558234,0.0075977147,-0.06486042,0.02594126,0.1429306,0.13811155,0.026209777,-0.1663731,0.07942656,0.0044497773,0.20761363,0.13892603,0.06244663,-0.09663816,-0.14051397,-0.14160115,0.34381178,-0.076253526,0.08311674,0.06069393,0.035818517,-0.03292142,0.29626673,0.096767426,-0.28224334,-0.25442016,0.22345579,0.09705107,0.13068941,0.10016921,-0.13396369,0.07045406,-0.019614812,-0.0660793,0.009065278,-0.1011837,-0.27093828,-0.03501302,-0.23326644,0.078720845,0.06612953

9808147,1998,"Generalized matter couplings to four-dimensional supersymmetric sigma models
on general Kaehler manifolds are presented, preserving all holomorphic
symmetries. Our generalization allows assignment of arbitrary U(1) charges to
additional matter fermions, in all representations of (the holomorphic part of)
the isometry group. This can be used to eliminate unwanted gamma_5 anomalies,
in particular for the U(1) symmetry arising from the complex structure of the
target space. A consistent gauging of this isometry group, or any of its
subgroups, then becomes possible. When gauged in the presence of a chiral
scalar multiplet, the U(1) symmetry is broken spontaneously, generating a mass
for the U(1) vector multiplet via the supersymmetric Higgs effect. As an
example we discuss the case of the homogeneous coset space E6/SO(10) x U(1).",-0.36425453,0.10087356,0.018431082,-0.102413505,-0.005142808,0.41231084,-0.16851205,-0.06700043,-0.062133886,0.28385198,-0.27404743,0.13878816,0.25785792,-0.52352935,0.039359562,0.051766604,-0.15222506,-0.16925043,-0.103656955,-0.045838416,-0.3861637,-0.030079156,-0.053039446,0.04786192,0.013544455,-0.2066418,0.20525,-0.08693807,0.24463612,0.14555395,0.05659689,-0.15208554,0.0021227747,-0.10744623,-0.046061225,-0.17574055,-0.14616841,-0.4753542,-0.12430098,0.021274228,-0.085301936,-0.2590049,0.20389748,0.19281963,-0.2224257,-0.09831468,0.2879771,0.005891447,0.14096236,0.029398948,-0.22838977,0.14423518,-0.27148968,-0.046756405,0.093587674,-0.036219016,0.03770943,-0.005072713,0.36117345,-0.208102,0.10175948,-0.052353315,-0.1029893,0.1992293,-0.17845766,0.21955,0.030223504,-0.13875167,-0.015024421,-0.20961443,-0.059316486,0.33479577,0.02194409,0.0695711,0.22449316,0.07813875,-0.1107057,0.03527563,-0.1992942,-0.024898924,0.07316532,-0.08559645,0.18762177,0.23525776,0.19785178,0.12737006,0.105332665,-0.19481231,0.13642927,-0.12684612,-0.39262033,-0.13499111,-0.13256302,0.01629394,0.03308066,-0.058117516,0.04941903,-0.06914574,-0.09012975,-0.3986161,0.12790558,0.0052086115,-0.05369622,-0.02485647,0.11645452,0.023617193,-0.0785246,-0.017874151,-0.03317702,-0.06189379,0.123978145,0.38710445,0.43699688,-0.18340898,0.116990745,-0.43363822,-0.1800568,-0.009024739,-0.24357939,0.12612194,-0.14555177,0.09363892,-0.3421144,0.118120715,-0.17932603,-0.19472668,0.07268123,-0.06824711

relations arising in the statistical mechanics of matrix models, by deriving
several related Ward identities, and give conditions for these corrections to

9701029,1997,"We calculate within an algebraic Bjorken-Johnson-Low (BJL) method anomalous
Schwinger terms of fermionic currents and the Gauss law operator in chiral
gauge theories. The current algebra is known to violate the Jacobi identity in
an iterative computation. Our method takes the subtleties of the equal-time
limit into account and leads to an algebra that fulfills the Jacobi identity.
The non-iterative terms appearing in the double commutators can be traced back
directly to the projective representation of the gauge group.",-0.27374047,0.016055748,0.09538445,-0.10521546,-0.18189941,0.113434285,-0.14209454,0.0527429,-0.06950185,0.37531307,-0.22134867,0.036994927,-0.11316657,-0.23125747,-0.045339778,-0.015211701,0.41755715,0.07699488,-0.36829123,-0.027411755,-0.22333114,0.061105754,-0.09116043,-0.045601398,0.37178615,0.04496313,0.13787654,0.31795377,-0.13991266,-0.19245665,-0.02720287,0.18261084,-0.025563478,-0.17340389,-0.117188245,0.086366385,-0.18324059,0.050524876,-0.0133996885,0.19177614,-0.036371335,-0.08192499,0.022209354,-0.16060592,-0.26539987,-0.22412945,0.056824327,-0.066990994,0.20599027,-0.24755192,-0.09807278,-0.27948767,0.18884632,-0.31569555,-0.004060395,-0.21593101,0.07038392,-0.11622769,0.4000893,0.26916313,0.036050357,0.01293695,-0.04248695,-0.2226431,0.3781706,0.22307342,0.123872474,-0.016397178,-0.1251562,-0.14481321,0.13878743,0.18928018,0.17633623,0.12632123,-0.08347233,0.05637528,0.040179998,0.522231,-0.22852123,-0.11641889,-0.047266245,-0.05160021,-0.019631512,-0.08668032,-0.078035,-0.056495115,0.013457969,0.25976798,0.34633672,-0.20431861,-0.11783914,-0.23547025,-0.22792575,0.16136251,-0.015086636,-0.040677175,-0.22728914,-0.38720548,-0.07127276,0.078567445,-0.031013913,0.088325456,-0.07324619,0.18069631,0.2566603,0.11868134,-0.40273437,0.18547854,-0.14291172,0.11815217,-0.10033272,0.19737047,-0.011110187,-0.049643993,-0.4939501,-0.0013157583,0.12910262,0.31107426,0.06219843,0.17686161,-0.044369943,0.1365826,-0.09488343,0.10591279,-0.15597206,0.0063811615,-0.09222016,-0.022766575

computed at finite temperature and density using a real-time formalism. We
discuss the gauge invariance of the result. Corrections to the Debye mass from

is reviewed and some of its applications are described. These applications
include the manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric calculation of scattering
amplitudes, the construction of a super-Poincar\'e invariant open superstring
field theory, and the beta-function calculation of low-energy equations of

9906184,1999,"The canonical structure of pure Yang-Mills theory is analysed in the case
when Gauss' law is satisfied identically by construction. It is shown that the
theory has a canonical structure in this case, provided one uses a special
gauge condition, which is a natural generalisation of the Coulomb gauge
condition of electrodynamics. The emergence of a canonical structure depends
critically also on the boundary conditions used for the relevant field
variables. Possible boundary conditions are analysed in detail. A comparison of
the present formulation in the generalised Coulomb gauge with the well known
Weyl gauge ($A_{0} = 0$) formulation is made. It appears that the Hamiltonians
in these two formulations differ from one another in a non-trivial way. It is
still an open question whether these differences give rise to truly different
structures upon quantisation. An extension of the formalism to include coupling
to fermionic fields is briefly discussed.",0.18012197,-0.04248166,-0.003112264,-0.19150716,-0.15460807,0.156912,0.082012504,-0.0022156388,0.061703496,-0.2632908,-0.42775166,0.119185165,-0.31514788,-0.051967256,0.19129112,0.3059233,0.0056164116,0.08004138,0.043880805,-0.71581537,0.067072436,0.23313282,-0.19571713,0.061584786,0.33887473,0.2781904,0.06552876,-0.19038562,0.15043022,0.057477027,0.097534746,-0.17060132,0.34026974,0.19720611,0.21315695,-0.31912756,-0.3954193,0.10141453,-0.365187,-0.33542335,-0.1008919,-0.20745406,0.24094868,-0.59994954,-0.042447373,-0.057542376,0.044994324,-0.3215614,-0.45437533,0.1966988,-0.021957561,-0.08181967,0.07205002,-0.41985363,-0.11512008,-0.22773288,-0.17082588,0.0008125901,0.27027065,-0.12669757,0.40488628,-0.4328184,0.014787156,0.28921452,-0.21013132,-0.07366508,0.41894245,0.18603276,0.5345043,0.028829843,-0.5370671,0.0629462,-0.19340187,0.2513355,-0.059235305,0.037929237,-0.105446935,0.038200334,0.7745139,-0.375015,-0.1905753,0.45252055,0.3518898,0.06962088,0.16496277,0.05051221,-0.2534248,0.17312126,-0.24569763,-0.13950501,0.009675071,0.028814776,-0.647518,0.49675477,-0.17202035,0.27526754,0.020416066,-0.222251,0.45792356,0.2907823,-0.17394888,0.27324623,-0.14964676,0.0041213147,0.3923088,-0.04955858,0.2732941,-0.12695631,0.18540373,0.3894195,0.09609549,-0.27536842,0.17412868,-0.6174258,-0.030461013,0.52528965,0.79819804,-0.283327,-0.2814727,0.09041767,-0.5590603,0.04052162,-0.019404307,-0.46438223,-0.2084623,-0.34422496,-0.22513121,-0.114721

9904137,1999,"We argue that a description of supersymmetric extended objects from a unified
geometric point of view requires an enlargement of superspace. To this aim we
study in a systematic way how superspace groups and algebras arise from
Grassmann spinors when these are assumed to be the only primary entities. In
the process, we recover generalized spacetime superalgebras and extensions of
supersymmetry found earlier. The enlargement of ordinary superspace with new
parameters gives rise to extended superspace groups, on which manifestly
supersymmetric actions may be constructed for various types of p-branes,
including D-branes (given by Chevalley-Eilenberg cocycles) with their
Born-Infeld fields. This results in a field/extended superspace democracy for
superbranes: all brane fields appear as pull-backs from a suitable target
superspace. Our approach also clarifies some facts concerning the origin of the
central charges for the different p-branes.",0.15634823,0.24433309,-0.12935674,-0.019070268,0.24904954,0.2839607,-0.30555284,0.102863476,-0.068895325,0.15076697,-0.115474105,0.052264273,-0.14388752,0.006044969,0.22628655,-0.035243526,-0.06282256,0.047795486,0.16825312,0.25691175,-0.08020321,0.17215583,-0.053511314,0.128435,0.14298886,-0.032339767,-0.10566397,0.00071169436,0.28720427,-0.26635242,-0.07817829,-0.22768617,0.0017312616,0.16835344,-0.008884149,0.07233683,-0.17210475,-0.42982,0.10879309,0.09412361,-0.04606182,-0.03498976,-0.3011088,-0.1546913,0.06859802,0.20370787,-0.1713188,-0.19781059,-0.0108643025,0.2759068,0.15271352,0.0042483658,-0.035149787,-0.017673612,0.0372207,0.028608978,-0.20363523,0.100287974,0.18547177,-0.18376538,0.1580606,0.2684237,0.0413631,0.12985757,0.064564355,-0.3530054,-0.03553784,-0.035183445,-0.028979335,-0.061519787,0.069641724,0.17873546,0.17446809,0.0019986853,-0.0376865,-0.22081758,0.087577134,-0.12976079,-0.008860856,0.15187424,-0.104095995,-0.06229209,-0.047440108,0.053943217,0.098363,0.020272732,0.1373438,0.22234154,-0.16948822,-0.13254768,0.03028313,-0.04145302,-0.2193764,0.036416203,0.17293411,0.16523562,0.05193455,-0.28068537,0.016653497,0.17808495,-0.03801298,0.41331315,-0.12147753,-0.005916204,-0.0050226897,-0.12939095,0.034583062,0.17229947,-0.094604425,-0.086284086,-0.20220664,-0.18805933,0.117604345,-0.10507455,0.04118275,0.048877068,0.2784585,-0.057959557,-0.35199517,0.08864238,-0.034701083,0.17787081,-0.16552486,0.18328947,0.0047539026,-0.14388813,0.038447097,-0.060776353

9903248,1999,"We analyse the canonical structure of AdS_3 gravity in terms of the coadjoint
orbits of the Virasoro group. There is one subset of orbits, associated to BTZ
black hole solutions, that can be described by a pair of chiral free fields
with a background charge. There is also a second subset of orbits, associated
to point-particle solutions, that are described by two pairs of chiral free
fields obeying a constraint. All these orbits admit K\""ahler quantization and
generate a Hilbert space which, despite of having $\Delta_0(\bar{\Delta}_0)=0$,
does not provide the right degeneracy to account for the Bekenstein-Hawking

9602111,1996,"Extremal BPS-saturated black holes in $N=2$, $d=4$ supergravity can carry
electric and magnetic charges $(q^\Lambda_{(m)},q_\Lambda^{(e)})$. It is shown
that in smooth cases the moduli fields at the horizon take a fixed ""rational""
value $X^\Lambda(q_{(m)},q^{(e)})$ which is determined by the charges and is
independent of the asymptotic values of the moduli fields. A universal formula

9909201,1999,"We show that the recently formulated Equivalence Principle (EP) implies a
basic cocycle condition both in Euclidean and Minkowski spaces, which holds in
any dimension. This condition, that in one-dimension is sufficient to fix the
Schwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental higher dimensional Moebius
invariance which in turn univocally fixes the quantum version of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This holds also in the relativistic case, so that we
obtain both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation in any dimension. We then show that the EP implies that masses are
related by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting different
physical systems. Furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription,
and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the EP.

9709024,1997,"Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) is a technique to deal with
D-dimensional Feynman loop integrals. Since most of the physical quantities in
perturbative Quantum Field Theory (pQFT) require the ability of solving them,
the quicker and easier the method to evaluate them the better. The NDIM is a
novel and promising technique, ipso facto requiring that we put it to test in
different contexts and situations and compare the results it yields with those
that we already know by other well-established methods. It is in this
perspective that we consider here the calculation of an on-shell two-loop three
point function in a massless theory. Surprisingly this approach provides twelve
non-trivial results in terms of double power series. More astonishing than this
is the fact that we can show these twelve solutions to be different

dimensions with background fluxes. We provide a simple construction of
supersymmetric vacua, including some with orientifold descriptions. These
vacua, which have warp factors, typically have fewer moduli than conventional
Calabi-Yau compactifications. The mechanism for anomaly cancellation in the
orientifold models involves background RR and NS fluxes. We consider in detail
an orientifold of $K3\times T^2$ with background fluxes. After a combination of
T and S-dualities, this type IIB orientifold is mapped to a compactification of

9908096,1999,"We study the question of existence and the number of normalized vacuum states
in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills quantum mechanics for any gauge group. The mass
deformation method is the simplest and clearest one. It allowed us to calculate
the number of normalized vacuum states for all gauge groups. For all unitary
groups, #(vac) = 1, but for the symplectic groups [starting from Sp(6) ], for
the orthogonal groups [starting from SO(8)] and for all the exceptional groups,
it is greater than one. We also discuss at length the functional integral
method. We calculate the ``deficit term'' for some non-unitary groups and
predict the value of the integral giving the ``principal contribution''. The
issues like the Born-Oppenheimer procedure to derive the effective theory and
the manifestation of the localized vacua for the asymptotic effective wave

9208005,1992,"Classical random walks and Markov processes are easily described by Hopf
algebras. It is also known that groups and Hopf algebras (quantum groups) lead
to classical and quantum diffusions. We study here the more primitive notion of
a quantum random walk associated to a general Hopf algebra and show that it has
a simple physical interpretation in quantum mechanics. This is by means of a
representation theorem motivated from the theory of Kac algebras: If $H$ is any
Hopf algebra, it may be realised in $\Lin(H)$ in such a way that $\Delta
h=W(h\tens 1)W^{-1}$ for an operator $W$. This $W$ is interpreted as the time
evolution operator for the system at time $t$ coupled quantum-mechanically to
the system at time $t+\delta$. Finally, for every Hopf algebra there is a dual
one, leading us to a duality operation for quantum random walks and quantum
diffusions and a notion of the coentropy of an observable. The dual system has
its time reversed with respect to the original system, leading us to a CTP-type
theorem.",-0.120196015,-0.24686243,-0.14441782,-0.27159616,-0.28376552,-0.014202505,-0.39813006,-0.16832864,-0.0018387884,-0.03180909,-0.13569275,0.0054042786,0.19032139,0.16826153,-0.03724129,0.12705857,0.025238216,-0.17326093,-0.13573326,-0.019477315,-0.16399515,0.11576749,0.19316131,-0.25848916,-0.02972944,0.13862082,0.24253535,-0.24181312,0.19702524,-0.031610623,0.15442246,-0.19934735,-0.022185013,0.027324416,-0.22371544,0.14145167,0.26701003,-0.29673654,-0.10061476,-0.04797803,-0.14916898,0.009873763,-0.10870566,0.12282866,-0.12388526,0.16665569,0.15535335,-0.01080529,0.19196889,0.36795914,-0.0030550212,-0.14592102,0.016813677,-0.05327156,0.22663714,-0.42709643,-0.09853379,-0.03159657,0.1861966,-0.17031533,0.2915974,-0.03400671,0.15333688,-0.08341845,-0.19334245,0.12662074,-0.09648106,-0.13616455,0.23441885,-0.059045717,-0.06440664,0.060636625,-0.06277907,0.18125501,0.04330431,-0.08754425,0.32144082,0.2299315,-0.15123819,-0.009055853,-0.18143469,-0.18158439,-0.050728414,0.42409116,-0.013166815,0.19999507,-0.26910007,0.14677453,0.031341806,0.30085933,-0.0031498,-0.10658375,-0.3298123,0.32907534,-0.07140137,0.12500924,0.035381846,-0.03055942,-0.18582135,0.14164576,0.4207384,0.23719609,-0.06326917,-0.069089845,-0.084436074,-0.21806031,-0.54636997,0.22107719,0.061401635,0.016719371,0.24746032,0.12341759,0.29329935,-0.037787005,-0.15045783,-0.14797062,-0.18565667,0.05118808,-0.16331086,-0.047847696,0.08787218,-0.032525286,-0.2783002,0.02018493,-0.20725374,0.20334344,-0.016972192,0.3028111

9610023,1996,"In this work we use constructs from the dual space of the semi-direct product
of the Virasoro algebra and the affine Lie algebra of a circle to write a
theory of gravitation which is a natural analogue of Yang-Mills theory. The
theory provides a relation between quadratic differentials in 1+1 dimensions
and rank two symmetric tensors in higher dimensions as well as a covariant
local Lagrangian for two dimensional gravity. The isotropy equations of
coadjoint orbits are interpreted as Gauss law constraints for a field theory in
two dimensions, which enables us to extend to higher dimensions. The theory has
a Newtonian limit in any space-time dimension. Our approach introduces a novel

9409133,1994,"We quantize Quantum Electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions coupled to a
Chern-Simons (CS) term and a charged spinor field, in covariant gauges and in
the Coulomb gauge. The resulting Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory describes
charged fermions interacting with each other and with topologically massive
propagating photons. We impose Gauss's law and the gauge conditions and
investigate their effect on the dynamics and on the statistics of $n$-particle
states. We construct charged spinor states that obey Gauss's law and the gauge
conditions, and transform the theory to representations in which these states
constitute a Fock space. We demonstrate that, in these representations, the
nonlocal interactions between charges and between charges and transverse
currents, as well as the interactions between currents and massive propagating
photons, are identical in the different gauges we analyze in this and in
earlier work. We construct the generators of the Poincar\'e group, show that
they implement the Poincar\'e algebra, and explicitly demonstrate the effect of
rotations and Lorentz boosts on the particle states. We show that the
imposition of Gauss's law does not produce any ``exotic'' fractional
statistics. In the case of the covariant gauges, this demonstration makes use
of unitary transformations that provide charged particles with the gauge fields
required by Gauss's law, but that leave the anticommutator algebra of the
spinor fields untransformed. In the Coulomb gauge, we show that the
anticommutators of the spinor fields apply to the Dirac-Bergmann constraint
surfaces, on which Gauss's law and the gauge conditions obtain. We examine MCS
theory in the large CS coupling constant limit, and compare that limiting form
with CS theory, in which the Maxwell kinetic energy term is not included in the",0.039463595,-0.18284431,0.025508527,0.17754367,-0.20357431,0.29379588,0.026011728,-0.12759018,-0.0031249225,0.18532708,0.28304026,-0.007466212,-0.0045574605,0.03512326,-0.1484482,0.06428109,-0.031597164,-0.07279576,-0.122823775,-0.043806996,-0.101414084,0.022399396,0.022935955,-0.035677254,-0.13987091,0.10579574,-0.11278733,-0.028418127,-0.05808516,0.19170024,-0.10242738,-0.14157009,-0.2968009,0.14234643,-0.2959608,-0.2534955,-0.14097157,0.004790053,0.0791357,0.029219858,-0.1532669,-0.018487822,-0.23589608,0.07307717,-0.17734158,0.10967147,0.106187865,-0.21161835,0.15665895,0.048205443,-0.1831288,-0.1671707,0.237941,-0.0063852686,-0.06299201,0.111059695,0.0072159804,-0.005406797,-0.12333435,-0.1585366,0.06877924,0.016529009,0.24220616,-0.015781391,0.3427917,0.06554169,0.31541753,-0.27791107,0.053745046,-0.32326132,-0.27283418,0.16821645,0.2215271,-0.070177585,0.041525424,0.21630679,0.14705066,0.08804965,0.12973182,0.17898765,-0.008761935,0.17484953,-0.11748479,0.091208324,0.19631997,0.07127511,-0.010872155,0.28042355,0.022192806,-0.0018085688,-0.08103095,-0.13979517,0.16041446,-0.20833145,-0.00026117126,0.07934885,0.025697168,-0.2574586,0.30095848,-0.09852319,-0.021196336,0.05638911,0.14763516,-0.047475196,0.5320669,-0.3348477,0.009401262,-0.25473604,0.09820247,-0.021881968,0.023441214,0.23099104,0.36490625,0.18774962,-0.025086902,-0.21115483,-0.08237664,0.07210168,-0.010660037,0.059972838,0.035391428,0.37485072,-0.035159558,-0.012868267,-0.20884694,-0.08105834,0.07591025,-0.09202293
9607075,1996,"We solve the Dyson--Schwinger equation for the quark propagator in a model
with singular infrared behavior for the gluon propagator. We require that the
solutions, easily found in configuration space, be tempered distributions and
thus have Fourier transforms. This severely limits the boundary conditions that
the solutions may satisify. The sign of the dimensionful parameter that
characterizes the model gluon propagator can be either positive or negative. If
the sign is negative, we find a unique solution. It is singular at the origin
in momentum space, falls off like $1/p^2$ as $p^2\rightarrow +/-\infty$, and it
is truly nonperturbative in that it is singular in the limit that the
gluon--quark interaction approaches zero. If the sign of the gluon propagator
coefficient is positive, we find solutions that are, in a sense that we
exhibit, unconstrained linear combinations of advanced and retarded
propagators. These solutions are singular at the origin in momentum space, fall
off like $1/p^2$ asympotically, exhibit ``resonant--like"" behavior at the
position of the bare mass of the quark when the mass is large compared to the
dimensionful interaction parameter in the gluon propagator model, and smoothly
approach a linear combination of free--quark, advanced and retarded two--point
functions in the limit that the interaction approaches zero. In this sense,
these solutions behave in an increasingly ``particle--like"" manner as the quark
becomes heavy. The Feynman propagator and the Wightman function are not
tempered distributions and therefore are not acceptable solutions to the
Schwinger--Dyson equation in our model. On this basis we advance several
arguments to show that the Fourier--transformable solutions we find are
consistent with quark confinement, even though they have singularities on the",-0.21374837,0.08994269,-0.13765842,0.053108793,-0.1857146,-0.36971563,0.16667463,0.14324868,-0.17969099,-0.051561743,0.12763195,0.30323827,-0.16341229,0.1668042,0.22208805,-0.022474641,0.3086949,-0.022507936,0.06332303,0.25115633,-0.023885317,-0.07832761,0.08330093,0.0074811447,-0.06688653,-0.17189488,0.05505128,0.012941889,-0.05584672,0.09986287,0.035316724,-0.08184807,0.06222957,-0.018968802,0.050640933,-0.00085376203,0.22737241,0.10079395,-0.052119818,-0.24149117,0.33534005,-0.11725833,0.12839437,0.06654972,0.12683985,0.08377576,-0.07837532,-0.17277826,-0.20398235,-0.12649807,-0.2712296,0.27435842,0.047257483,0.052753028,-0.02445878,-0.235113,0.19832222,0.28562796,-0.083302885,-0.24255502,-0.04647667,0.13804837,0.13036586,0.0990704,-0.18385085,-0.19713037,-0.2633391,0.30233788,0.1382026,0.053234965,0.20327234,-0.15226686,-0.20626995,0.15041213,0.21357813,0.07168171,-0.03868083,-0.05499544,0.012311719,0.004477918,0.101042524,-0.024804853,-0.030693602,-0.040847436,-0.38366902,0.008795949,-0.12914227,0.17682771,-0.0691082,0.0053118803,-0.040028863,0.074206516,-0.11328778,0.0053967107,0.14268474,-0.10951404,0.25047418,0.20462826,-0.06319086,0.068680406,-0.10627185,-0.17862357,0.063702635,-0.043659456,-0.09628104,-0.12292393,0.1360976,0.04957986,0.04961687,0.26980308,0.0021348102,-0.102006376,-0.08005045,0.10107454,0.11852977,-0.1525056,-0.2022312,-0.29781273,-0.036477614,0.07894215,-0.11274078,-0.09309345,-0.049517922,0.20889916,0.35956874,0.23545569,-0.071834855,0.0906318

9710146,1997,"We derive modular anomaly equations from the Seiberg-Witten-Donagi curves for
softly broken N=4 SU(n) gauge theories. From these equations we can derive
recursion relations for the pre-potential in powers of m^2, where m is the mass
of the adjoint hypermultiplet. Given the perturbative contribution of the
pre-potential and the presence of ``gaps'' we can easily generate the m^2
expansion in terms of polynomials of Eisenstein series, at least for relatively
low rank groups. This enables us to determine efficiently the instanton
expansion up to fairly high order for these gauge groups, e. g. eighth order
for SU(3). We find that after taking a derivative, the instanton expansion of
the pre-potential has integer coefficients. We also postulate the form of the

9701016,1997,"We examine harmonic oscillator defects coupled to a photon field in the
environs of an optical fiber. Using techniques borrowed or extended from the
theory of two dimensional quantum fields with boundaries and defects, we are
able to compute exactly a number of interesting quantities. We calculate the
scattering S-matrices (i.e. the reflection and transmission amplitudes) of the
photons off a single defect. We determine using techniques derived from
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) the thermodynamic potentials of the
interacting photon-defect system. And we compute several correlators of
physical interest. We find the photon occupancy at finite temperature, the
spontaneous emission spectrum from the decay of an excited state, and the
correlation functions of the defect degrees of freedom. In an extension of the
single defect theory, we find the photonic band structure that arises from a
periodic array of harmonic oscillators. In another extension, we examine a
continuous array of defects and exactly derive its dispersion relation. With
some differences, the spectrum is similar to that found for EM wave propagation
in covalent crystals. We then add to this continuum theory isolated defects, so
as to obtain a more realistic model of defects embedded in a frequency
dependent dielectric medium. We do this both with a single isolated defect and
with an array of isolated defects, and so compute how the S-matrices and the
band structure change in a dynamic medium.",-0.025097895,0.047465183,-0.010270059,0.0901819,0.15337856,-0.43688664,0.14058582,-0.16481246,-0.022996943,-0.07227746,0.14508551,-0.13770847,-0.034464616,-0.017321099,0.08657478,0.15109994,0.13664949,0.1615626,-0.15188244,0.27921334,-0.17710994,0.009265754,-0.11950654,-0.12157319,-0.002315089,-0.07027202,-0.14436921,-0.02393455,0.06894817,0.15736881,0.2180362,0.0652793,-0.04179997,0.12767884,-0.028641503,-0.060439706,-0.039840244,0.16468865,0.036926486,-0.027303409,0.06003413,0.13719772,-0.050579734,-0.18663415,-0.2785434,-0.23031855,-0.040157773,0.0072903484,0.023752548,-0.07962178,0.06864645,0.09056759,0.01768221,0.15688446,0.037547164,0.009762455,0.16945454,0.046985492,-0.13039923,0.17587969,0.07461081,-0.046623234,0.1565575,0.001692038,0.0769313,0.22232838,0.29909408,-0.073304266,0.027963988,0.17072195,0.1443267,-0.003029883,-0.030904144,0.017896265,-0.11584112,-0.01280294,-0.29680067,-0.03908432,0.008347357,-0.2120175,0.070892274,0.21992059,-0.11009258,-0.160304,-0.034067098,-0.13504785,0.027227873,-0.12804279,-0.030229151,-0.32143322,-0.1391854,0.025004819,-0.0003293082,0.14266205,0.13076338,0.12127635,-0.07895172,0.068573825,0.10016985,-0.0025619054,-0.08245535,-0.22478843,0.1161506,0.14165902,0.25246078,0.0019567162,-0.027488295,-0.060882717,0.0676765,0.17259634,-0.029057622,0.14880809,-0.13463627,0.1762064,-0.061813377,-0.03686353,-0.10803079,-0.0239874,0.05829589,-0.15345265,0.056119956,-0.11424344,0.14371893,0.07749452,0.046411444,-0.06306586,0.12706988,0.1616633

9307143,1993,"A common belief is that further quantum corrections near the singularity of a
large black hole should not substantially modify the semiclassical picture of
black hole evaporation; in particular, the outgoing spectrum of radiation
should be very close to the thermal spectrum predicted by Hawking. In this
paper we explore a possible counterexample: in the context of dilaton gravity,
we find that non-perturbative quantum corrections which are important in strong
coupling regions may completely alter the semiclassical picture, to the extent
that the presumptive space-like boundary becomes time-like, changing in this
way the causal structure of the semiclassical geometry. As a result, only a
small fraction of the total energy is radiated outside the fake event horizon;
most of the energy comes in fact at later retarded times and there is no
information loss problem. Thus we propose that this may constitute a general
characteristic of quantum black holes, that is, quantum gravity might be such
as to prevent the formation of global event horizons. We argue that this is not
unnatural from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics.",-0.04219395,-0.023367813,-0.15168403,0.07879977,0.18408783,0.102804065,0.074217424,0.030487824,-0.36409414,-0.33597738,-0.36434758,-0.2572049,-0.07731053,-0.053044952,-0.36736968,-0.1603927,0.03744239,-0.08364751,-0.08632833,-0.20419572,0.32815152,-0.12044807,-0.046555888,0.032425597,0.30436656,-0.1780747,0.32825163,0.11857703,0.4143283,0.05773455,-0.3188027,0.04963562,0.2171914,-0.023843165,-0.043029495,0.08669021,-0.57531166,0.1964354,-0.24962592,-0.010656001,-0.39566532,-0.08109081,-0.27108842,-0.23109373,-0.4029894,0.002477929,0.2161803,0.12854359,-0.33038315,-0.09299435,-0.0073082894,-0.28347722,0.107173234,-0.021006731,0.09951759,0.49981695,-0.28138316,0.06568888,0.55040693,0.17231812,-0.08815044,0.22809583,-0.41381714,-0.03999821,-0.11586934,-0.022036968,0.16617343,0.08541499,-0.20064026,-0.2211306,0.15028493,0.051905215,-0.29343426,-0.07523453,0.08855742,-0.2285821,0.20457256,0.21216646,0.28356248,-0.06034448,-0.056312025,0.10080984,-0.026223997,-0.17079619,0.30166396,0.020734325,-0.13801296,0.3624696,-0.37807935,0.08216836,0.08521003,-0.1567199,-0.21282592,0.37268707,0.06294127,0.45461518,-0.3342648,-0.32149443,-0.027677786,0.1921481,0.048418477,0.43199077,0.16640714,0.20557301,0.087870136,0.013892606,0.14488302,0.2514498,-0.004308507,0.10355005,-0.27099234,0.08466338,-0.04261212,-0.010208774,0.13910633,0.22286436,-0.0052565215,0.12747794,0.0027322695,0.15348999,0.28498,-0.042679995,0.02174151,-0.08277707,-0.56594586,-0.15905586,0.2800063,-0.19166934

9509157,1995,"In Abelian theories of monopoles the magnetic charge is required to be
enormous. Using the electric-magnetic duality of electromagnetism it is argued
that the existence of such a large, non-perturbative magnetic coupling should
lead to a phase transition where magnetic charge is permanently confined and
the photon becomes massive. The apparent masslessness of the photon could then
be used as an argument against the existence of such a large, non-perturbative
magnetic charge. Finally it is shown that even in the presence of this
dynamical mass generation the Cabbibo-Ferrari formulation of magnetic charge
gives a consistent theory.",0.59335566,0.45296195,0.2829664,0.15499637,0.5482681,-0.2359223,0.1378785,0.27602947,-0.1384088,-0.11330273,0.2868993,-0.038282793,0.031350948,0.05604276,0.4587875,-0.2715476,-0.1304428,0.56718594,-0.3745286,0.4082117,-0.08433073,-0.42779136,-0.01579386,0.07598097,-0.10305898,-0.33221507,-0.24391098,-0.11097158,0.07832387,0.34117168,0.3097428,0.5225691,-0.085830756,-0.24019209,0.27583468,-0.17523748,0.003752783,0.009371623,-0.13804752,0.26450083,-0.07223325,0.11866577,0.41370398,0.33814767,0.19539234,0.18053512,-0.66938865,-0.25135434,0.039174877,-0.028633386,0.19892487,0.41363367,-0.011411607,-0.039108213,0.1622224,-0.20420477,-0.7481822,0.117108285,-0.4329883,0.25131544,0.14485258,-0.08092643,-0.29977137,0.103520654,0.021946192,0.2616371,0.009451485,0.07009033,-0.15273467,-0.19008532,-0.0544741,-0.010557592,-0.22854857,0.21710464,-0.31208283,0.04524578,-0.23355162,0.13683616,-0.33061248,-0.22064583,-0.29318216,-0.34738216,-0.058275476,0.22860374,0.4839151,0.2717022,0.39752418,0.20752369,0.035550646,-0.17528692,-0.36713368,0.23794498,-0.22746658,-0.12820823,0.18499102,0.09997147,0.4464712,-0.3314963,0.19833979,-0.13363878,-0.22498825,0.06678747,-0.30416572,0.3256423,-0.07185321,0.26852405,-0.062900655,-0.23976016,-0.25805935,-0.20016617,0.34221706,-0.06836658,0.1020509,0.074566066,-0.045937687,-0.07568258,0.0414211,0.2057235,0.3389408,-0.20368475,-0.20270273,0.5942731,-0.12512751,-0.40045816,-0.015242308,0.3194107,-0.14103559,-0.10484141

with respect to the partial ordering provided by divisibility of the height,

fusion rings in the limit of infinite level. This projective limit constitutes
a mathematically well-defined prescription for the `classical limit' of WZW
theories which replaces the naive idea of `sending the level to infinity'. The
projective limit can be endowed with a natural topology, which plays an
important role for studying its structure. The representation theory of the

9305155,1993,"We investigate the canonical quantization of gravity coupled to pointlike
matter in 2+1 dimensions. Starting from the usual point particle action in the
first order formalism, we introduce auxiliary variables which make the action
locally Poincar\'e invariant. A Hamiltonian analysis shows that the gauge group
is actually larger than the Poincar\'e group -- certain additional gauge
constraints are present which act on the matter degrees of freedom. These
additional constraints are necessary to mimic the diffeomorphism invariance
present if the theory is formulated with a spacetime metric. The additional
gauge constraints are realized projectively in the quantum theory, with a phase
in the composition law for finite gauge transformations. That phase is
responsible for the braid invariance of physical observables (holonomies).",0.15728799,0.22694367,-0.1724636,0.42269316,-0.2250071,-0.08330166,-0.09204872,-0.14701189,-0.072862834,-0.32695308,0.23711072,0.046912834,-0.09967542,-0.18278328,0.15282327,0.22715148,-0.30631235,0.14441592,0.018144138,-0.7326608,0.00119932,0.0300463,0.20634934,-0.02600101,-0.13490646,-0.0018241405,0.1544298,0.13698252,0.0087588355,-0.17488465,-0.15153193,-0.105795875,0.13430458,-0.010253027,0.2524626,0.12627451,0.1517465,0.13592842,-0.008966595,-0.16368707,0.13711154,0.21626376,-0.013752345,-0.27548686,-0.36303315,-0.38456836,0.4260354,-0.22303623,0.02026254,0.12384072,0.24593195,-0.070728734,0.31253576,0.20180438,-0.094792806,0.24384773,-0.28604648,-0.14685881,-0.29158336,0.39450383,-0.052989095,-0.108169585,-0.09529631,0.03304258,-0.023606844,0.15806684,0.6006043,0.21232362,0.031702586,-0.33814058,0.15662831,0.054822743,-0.0070529133,-0.1523165,-0.058472585,-0.042321622,0.23926935,-0.20311114,-0.2026546,0.1289476,0.28472033,0.3752411,0.39917213,0.006716922,0.0848784,-0.39993864,0.21337295,0.00022350624,0.31585857,-0.06529513,0.1514456,-0.07784107,0.14388083,0.39393824,0.20190877,-0.23021668,-0.0315165,0.1520016,0.005670294,-0.042262807,-0.03806755,0.2589718,0.4317635,-0.16765477,0.5779992,0.15670076,0.33042535,0.2741136,-0.35157084,-0.28946787,-0.24645498,0.098222494,0.12945072,-0.38285822,-0.095266625,0.19553319,0.19129711,0.2640851,0.26652598,0.23995624,0.26832014,-0.10704483,-0.011110462,0.065690294,0.32768878,0.15943728,-0.17019199,-0.60959744

9708135,1997,"We describe a general way of constructing integrable defect theories as
perturbations of conformal field theory by local defect operators. The method
relies on folding the system onto a boundary field theory of twice the central
charge. The classification of integrable defect theories obtained in this way
parallels that of integrable bulk theories which are a perturbation of the
tensor product of two conformal field theories. These include local defect
perturbations of all $c<1$ minimal models, as well as of the coset theories
based on SO(2n), obtained in this way. We discuss in detail the former case of
all the Virasoro minimal models. In the Ising case our construction corresponds
to having a spin field as a defect operator; in the folded formulation this is
mapped onto an orbifolding of the boundary sine-Gordon theory at $\beta^2/8\pi
= 1/8$, or a version of the anisotropic Kondo model.",-0.10343364,-0.022996886,0.23571828,-0.481867,0.09168136,0.06525028,-0.15317594,-0.27275133,0.25135702,0.052234277,-0.026631951,0.01984343,0.04349852,0.009926841,-0.08323621,-0.27796137,-0.13624425,0.28019717,-0.09519891,-0.17224419,-0.13837078,-0.23344427,0.09096436,0.15931758,-0.2464501,0.15177454,0.109013826,0.006052178,-0.1350697,-0.13984334,-0.030856304,0.069925934,-0.0810034,-0.37973285,0.2837901,0.08855705,0.17965081,0.20805869,0.022424277,0.067257926,-0.13628325,-0.0033803806,0.1737091,0.047008973,-0.084609434,0.043903053,-0.18418208,0.082844734,-0.30850676,-0.25172538,0.0015791841,0.095804274,-0.14012438,-0.05522665,-0.00231059,0.22510763,0.24761596,-0.1714375,0.081558704,0.1881673,-0.32224265,-0.1973607,-0.23261316,0.07384686,-0.3290288,-0.12600045,0.3105719,0.18912019,-0.32673037,0.040727586,0.01674179,0.4529039,0.0066773742,-0.0055606216,-0.038603876,-0.017190747,-0.07825625,-0.21425325,0.01162041,0.018822905,-0.10722187,0.013783067,0.015929936,0.008739069,0.0330631,0.32977504,0.25575405,-0.05303882,0.057235338,-0.3629859,0.076233506,0.047674373,-0.20420767,-0.026204437,-0.08013719,-0.06381223,0.16516216,0.08077717,-0.13178927,-0.10403098,0.13752107,-0.07504259,-0.22710465,0.046861418,-0.20013325,-0.073102266,-0.031183004,-0.10042952,0.13905133,-0.23881823,0.35509342,-0.11448456,0.024866372,-0.019345343,0.02592744,-0.022102363,0.01767655,0.17414092,-0.05561893,0.043339066,0.057130314,0.022337884,-0.02083683,0.056706313,-0.13528624,-0.09683028,0.14263041,-0.3380865

9606100,1996,"We consider quantized Yang-Mills theories in the framework of causal
perturbation theory which goes back to Epstein and Glaser. In this approach
gauge invariance is expressed by a simple commutator relation for the S-matrix.
The most general coupling which is gauge invariant in first order contains a
two-parametric ambiguity in the ghost sector - a divergence- and a
coboundary-coupling may be added. We prove (not completely) that the higher
orders with these two additional couplings are gauge invariant, too. Moreover
we show that the ambiguities of the n-point distributions restricted to the
physical subspace are only a sum of divergences (in the sense of vector
analysis). It turns out that the theory without divergence- and
coboundary-coupling is the most simple one in a quite technical sense. The
proofs for the n-point distributions containing coboundary-couplings are given
up to third or fourth order only, whereas the statements about the
divergence-coupling are proven in all orders.",0.18551816,-0.070782594,-0.050270244,-0.110206045,0.19692102,0.046521932,-0.043494225,-0.034834936,0.17304003,-0.19096303,0.036009878,0.013728432,-0.084565684,0.06227245,0.0924141,-0.36756396,0.028512552,0.1308305,0.14480105,0.16117741,0.12470207,0.015370458,-0.040311646,0.29581442,-0.22449121,0.013736866,0.028469212,0.036346488,0.091882035,-0.051119715,0.16800526,0.1416046,0.005252242,0.025191989,0.009095877,0.030948874,-0.076379105,-0.036388412,0.0938376,0.10922027,0.16208056,0.06559823,0.020097762,0.046918605,0.05818687,0.12229052,0.03225106,-0.0025406852,0.35013562,0.09486285,0.10312897,-0.09917479,-0.07516581,0.08134273,0.01947257,-0.18047504,-0.124433324,-0.15693034,0.16386005,-0.23938353,0.3223435,0.039048612,0.0962353,-0.14182729,0.020080194,0.100908004,0.019313116,-0.16239013,0.11014716,-0.14653245,0.19477546,-0.0027909875,0.053438976,0.0475486,-0.09064876,0.12358401,0.1402893,0.083977096,-0.12416893,0.024232538,0.08641426,0.09891415,-0.19396819,0.20715018,0.10207477,0.14063336,0.026911885,0.2666205,0.093919545,0.014476422,0.096356235,0.07653482,-0.2208482,-0.048291918,0.01568106,-0.13214388,0.0067824535,-0.3299697,0.19062966,0.09198251,0.11942947,-0.025680318,-0.120161615,0.016792,-0.011880092,-0.03702529,0.023075148,0.0073385686,-0.069114685,-0.27841985,0.24961719,-0.06454089,-0.045023188,-0.014047787,-0.054740433,0.15031251,0.14506455,0.04419735,-0.029707413,0.07550028,0.17299637,-0.080994636,-0.2854371,0.052786127,-0.14250669,-0.061711818,0.13067573,-0.09508731

9702156,1997,"A metric is introduced on the space of parameters (couplings) describing the
large N limit of the O(N) model in Euclidean space. The geometry associated
with this metric is analysed in the particular case of the infinite volume
limit in 3 dimensions and it is shown that the Ricci curvature diverges at the
ultra-violet (Gaussian) fixed point but is finite and tends to constant
negative curvature at the infra-red (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point. The
renormalisation group flow is examined in terms of geodesics of the metric. The
critical line of cross-over from the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to the Gaussian
fixed point is shown to be a geodesic but all other renormalisation group
trajectories, which are repulsed from the Gaussian fixed point in the
ultra-violet, are not geodesics. The geodesic flow is interpreted in terms of a

9505173,1995,"We analyse in detail the local BRST cohomology in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory
using the antifield formalism. We do not restrict the Lagrangian to be the sum
of the standard Hilbert and Yang-Mills Lagrangians, but allow for more general
diffeomorphism and gauge invariant actions. The analysis is carried out in all
spacetime dimensions larger than 2 and for all ghost numbers. This covers the
classification of all candidate anomalies, of all consistent deformations of
the action, as well as the computation of the (equivariant) characteristic
cohomology, i.e. the cohomology of the spacetime exterior derivative in the
space of (gauge invariant) local differential forms modulo forms that vanish
on-shell. We show in particular that for a semi-simple Yang-Mills gauge group
the antifield dependence can be entirely removed both from the consistent
deformations of the Lagrangian and from the candidate anomalies. Thus, the
allowed deformations of the action necessarily preserve the gauge structure,
while the only candidate anomalies are those provided by previous works not
dealing with antifields, and by ``topological"" candidate anomalies which are
present only in special spacetime dimensions (6,9,10,13,...). This result no
longer holds in presence of abelian factors where new candidate anomalies and
deformations of the action can be constructed out of the conserved Noether
currents (if any). The Noether currents themselves are shown to be
covariantizable, with a few exceptions discussed as well.",-0.04871819,-0.07539198,0.13593845,-0.04067692,0.088806145,-0.13595632,-0.28527814,-0.14261143,-0.18677771,-0.22993614,-0.13360031,-0.33328927,-0.18915308,-0.095120944,-0.10766691,-0.112756565,-0.29151917,0.08602801,0.2195955,0.022329137,0.08088271,-0.07156479,0.20113382,0.20544983,-0.13309509,0.1884152,-0.083618745,-0.12446803,0.0048847347,-0.11349727,0.06371071,0.045126423,-0.0036385804,0.2212399,0.04171672,0.18044108,-0.2212455,0.121147305,-0.014161289,0.19444755,0.25773832,0.37017605,0.027112145,-0.18819304,-0.112055644,0.18271059,-0.2501685,-0.15530804,0.2969756,0.20176715,0.0759821,-0.14072599,0.14033234,0.12874685,0.32290426,-0.10971453,0.06934713,0.13508323,0.29241922,-0.18817514,0.37314904,0.13814385,-0.18478382,-0.26961467,0.094108485,-0.12708852,0.3328505,0.052469626,0.13601223,0.21292998,0.15966283,0.3045411,-0.013158739,-0.010882884,-0.10580283,-0.05247134,-0.058509827,0.14580877,0.15229551,0.024098597,-0.2831754,-0.13793541,0.041895546,0.34186566,0.105183005,-0.09910609,0.032465916,0.26558608,-0.25258172,-0.05478258,0.1364325,-0.1357258,-0.104866706,-0.23200923,0.2670013,0.09210549,0.18932612,0.13119039,-0.33727401,0.05730298,0.13015825,0.011793107,-0.13594255,-0.06895121,0.023595735,0.11569532,-0.24345201,-0.00012844801,0.13963592,-0.12092996,0.39762095,-0.060130812,0.26756197,-0.022856757,0.21745478,0.435113,0.27138254,-0.09700325,-0.095373824,0.08132513,0.2491076,-0.11700764,-0.070424594,0.0375627,-0.06870307,-0.007119827,-0.06844096,-0.36298108

9810066,1998,"The large $N_c$ limit of Yang-Mills gauge theory is the dynamics of a closed
gluonic chain, but this fact does not obviate the inherently strong coupling
nature of the dynamical problem. However, we suggest that a single link in such

9506105,1995,"Translationally invariant symmetric polynomials as coordinates for $N$-body
problems with identical particles are proposed. It is shown that in those
coordinates the Calogero and Sutherland $N$-body Hamiltonians, after
appropriate gauge transformations, can be presented as a {\it quadratic}
polynomial in the generators of the algebra $sl_N$ in finite-dimensional

9208029,1992,"We show that the BRST quantum version of pure D=4 N=2 supergravity can be
topologically twisted, to yield a formulation of topological gravity in four
dimensions. The topological BRST complex is just a rearrangement of the old
BRST complex, that partly modifies the role of physical and ghost fields:
indeed, the new ghost number turns out to be the sum of the old ghost number
plus the internal U(1) charge. Furthermore, the action of N=2 supergravity is
retrieved from topological gravity by choosing a gauge fixing that reduces the
space of physical states to the space of gravitational instanton
configurations, namely to self-dual spin connections. The descent equations
relating the topological observables are explicitly exhibited and discussed.
Ours is a first step in a programme that aims at finding the topological sector
of matter coupled N=2 supergravity, viewed as the effective Lagrangian of type

9709179,1997,"The Gross-Neveu model with chemical potential is investigated as a low-energy
effective theory of polyacetylene. In particular, we focus on the abrupt change
in the features of electric conductivity such as sharp rise in the Pauli
paramagnetism at dopant concentration of about 6%. We will try to explain it by
the finite density phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model. The thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz is combined with the large-N expansion to construct thermodynamics
of the Gross-Neveu model. A first-order phase transition is found in leading
order in the 1/N expansion and it appears to be stable against the 1/N

functions of integrals of local functions of the dynamical variable. In
contrast to many other non-local actions, the classical solution set of these

equations can be plausibly interpreted in quantum mechanics as different

9702163,1997,"We give an overview of various composite BPS configurations of string theory
and M-theory p-branes represented as classical supergravity solutions. Type II
string backgrounds can be obtained by S- and T- dualities from NS-NS string -
5-brane configurations corresponding to exact conformal sigma models. The
single-center solutions can be also generated from the Schwarzschild solution
by applying a sequence of boosts, dualities and taking the extremal limit.
Basic `marginal' backgrounds representing threshold BPS bound states of branes
are parametrised by a number of independent harmonic functions. `Non-marginal'
BPS configurations in D=10 can be constructed from marginal ones by using
U-duality and thus depend also on a number of O(d,d) and SL(2,R) parameters. We
present a new more general class of configurations in which some of the branes
or their intersections are localised on other branes. In particular, we find
the type IIB supergravity background describing the BPS configuration of a
3-brane, RR 5-brane and NS-NS 5-brane, and related `localised' 2-5-5 D=11
solution. We also consider the classical action for a 3-brane probe moving in
such backgrounds and determine the structure of the corresponding moduli space

9509075,1995,"This paper is an overview on our recent results in the calculation of the
heat kernel in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. We introduce a
deformation of the background fields (including the metric of a curved
spacetime manifold) and study various asymptotic expansions of the heat kernel
diagonal associated with this deformation. Especial attention is payed to the
low-energy approximation corresponding to the strong slowly varying background
fields. We develop a new covariant purely algebraic approach for calculating
the heat kernel diagonal in low-energy approximation by taking into account a
finite number of low-order covariant derivatives of the background fields, and
neglecting all covariant derivatives of higher orders. Then there exist a set
of covariant differential operators that together with the background fields
and their low-order derivatives generate a finite dimensional Lie algebra. In
the zeroth order of the low-energy perturbation theory, determined by
covariantly constant background, we use this algebraic structure to present the
heat operator in the form of an average over the corresponding Lie group. This
simplifies considerably the calculations and allows to obtain closed explicitly
covariant formulas for the heat kernel diagonal. These formulas serve as the
generating functions for the whole sequence of the Hadamard-Minakshisundaram-
De Witt-Seeley coefficients in the low-energy approximation.",-0.099885404,-0.014151489,0.03877359,-0.18142231,-0.10746292,-0.21009716,-0.26888496,0.045863688,0.23109561,0.022763416,-0.37226745,0.023819424,0.15641008,0.022500113,-0.0837105,0.10796375,0.11258374,0.327701,0.23281531,-0.15884554,-0.13740003,0.34504953,0.026928782,0.024940737,0.02760309,-0.03496494,0.11109473,0.15560307,-0.023308426,-0.20744313,-0.08451257,-0.101364,0.13334951,-0.15875395,0.018422075,0.15099534,-0.2618326,0.04361579,-0.07237741,0.1187944,0.109468505,-0.40158337,-0.07819571,0.17812428,-0.06560607,0.0023783073,-0.11639047,0.33684522,-0.11173636,0.28680006,-0.35678166,-0.043138705,0.022369787,0.021481004,-0.5234714,-0.22597256,-0.16693819,0.072956845,0.48897332,-0.19297178,0.2708787,0.110132664,-0.03056842,-0.14094284,0.039926015,0.3555047,-0.20539743,0.37995115,0.3370092,0.49847424,0.21772124,-0.2857523,0.17788373,0.27829143,0.055380642,-0.0567718,0.040346414,-0.23620622,0.17695515,0.020295314,-0.15431505,-0.08272262,-0.15998062,0.109825075,0.48901084,0.047643885,-0.08418916,-0.010623485,-0.16801944,0.2464472,0.047150195,-0.0573442,-0.1972179,-0.05598157,-0.12256032,0.43608278,0.13803054,-0.052498337,-0.2786203,0.009727091,0.15543541,0.11896938,0.041847162,-0.009448148,-0.12494806,-0.15368722,-0.051025845,0.23413795,-0.10924531,0.014116228,0.14038664,0.18342482,-0.20256233,-0.0906558,0.071792185,-0.12842962,0.2044175,0.16914959,-0.51631343,-0.38841677,-0.036808793,0.029610485,-0.034673385,-0.0463996,-0.08965941,-0.173,0.0077323467,-0.0058920234

9201017,1992,"In general quantum systems there are two kinds of spacetime modes, those that
fluctuate and those that do not. Fluctuating modes have normalizable
wavefunctions. In the context of 2D gravity and ``non-critical'' string theory
these are called macroscopic states. The theory is independent of the initial
Euclidean background values of these modes. Non-fluctuating modes have
non-normalizable wavefunctions and correspond to microscopic states. The theory
depends on the background value of these non-fluctuating modes, at least to all
orders in perturbation theory. They are superselection parameters and should
not be minimized over. Such superselection parameters are well known in field
theory. Examples in string theory include the couplings $t_k$ (including the
cosmological constant) in the matrix models and the mass of the two-dimensional
Euclidean black hole. We use our analysis to argue for the finiteness of the
string perturbation expansion around these backgrounds.",-0.017853253,0.03558371,0.05558495,-0.28294542,-0.19633801,0.14448941,-0.20829186,-0.08721432,-0.1061229,0.0018103272,-0.18047613,-0.26651633,-0.21413603,-0.2059482,0.22991918,-0.07009617,-0.023168925,0.17191765,0.08179107,-0.21910086,-0.041619316,0.23101178,0.14807163,0.058162827,0.057070933,0.23547322,-0.016255498,-0.1882441,-0.13111667,0.052539587,-0.31343195,-0.16413641,-0.19944583,0.1802074,-0.07266982,-0.18830192,-0.15343249,0.13729471,-0.11783492,-0.044060066,-0.2895531,-0.10073346,0.083190955,-0.01779218,-0.1084622,0.21092018,0.12901197,-0.1882523,-0.07830426,0.27163023,-0.0903777,-0.15814567,-0.121185124,-0.24464196,0.27330637,-0.0183537,-0.21151647,-0.2877771,0.15744177,0.09051496,0.17850016,0.08660547,-0.17111793,0.25764304,0.12127118,-0.16529107,-0.26957837,-0.1497684,0.043134317,-0.1223084,-0.005858331,0.064615965,0.02281402,0.045115918,0.15368849,-0.1866757,-0.14915666,0.1693649,0.11095297,-0.10334894,-0.031681113,-0.21198267,0.1419371,0.16560206,0.4243922,-0.034971893,-0.08649787,0.027459249,-0.05971332,0.01437928,0.101187326,0.1645124,-0.28983954,0.021255184,0.006276799,-0.00668706,0.05668095,0.09612298,-0.22551985,-0.2588565,-0.16270936,0.143798,-0.217414,-0.12776116,0.06474583,-0.13343725,-0.08138126,-0.00041799247,-0.28806797,0.02676168,0.02180478,-0.2383357,0.10423942,-0.2837979,-0.16308416,-0.0630627,-0.034752376,0.052554816,0.0047490746,0.10119559,-0.018624332,0.12912439,-0.09702416,-0.036156397,0.0054662675,0.27518722,-0.2251019,-0.0684157

3-torus. Although we consider theories with periodic boundary conditions,
twisted boundary conditions play an essential auxiliary role in our
construction. In this article we will limit ourselves to the simplest case,
based on twist in SU(2) subgroups. These reproduce the recently constructed new
vacua for SO(N) and G_2 theories on the 3-torus. We show how to embed the
results in the other exceptional groups F_4 and E_{6,7,8} and how to compute
the relevant unbroken subgroups. In a subsequent article we will generalise to
SU(N > 2) subgroups. The number of vacua found this way exactly matches the

9907171,1999,"We discover a realisation of the affine Lie superalgebra sl(2|1) and of the
exceptional affine superalgebra D(2|1;alpha) as vertex operator extensions of
two affine sl(2) algebras with dual levels (and an auxiliary level 1 sl(2)
algebra). The duality relation between the levels is (k+1)(k'+1)=1. We
construct the representation of sl(2|1) at level k' on a sum of tensor products
of sl(2) at level k, sl(2) at level k' and sl(2) at level 1 modules and
decompose it into a direct sum over the sl(2|1) spectral flow orbit. This
decomposition gives rise to character identities, which we also derive. The
extension of the construction to the affine D(2|1;k') at level k is traced to

9509045,1995,"In this paper we introduce a unified approach to Toda field theories which
allows us to formulate the classes of $A_n$, $B_n$ and $C_n$ models as unique
models involving an arbitrary continuous parameter $\nu$. For certain values of
$\nu $, the model describes the standard Toda theories. For other values of
$\nu$ it defines a class of models that involve infinitely many fields. These
models interpolate between the various standard Toda field theories. They are
conformally invariant and possess infinitely many conserved higher-spin
currents thus making them candidates for a new set of integrable systems. A
general construction is performed, which can effectively be used for the
derivation of explicit forms of particular higher-spin currents. We also study
the currents in a different representation in which they are linear in the
dynamical variables having, however, a non-linear Poisson bracket algebra. An
explicit formula for this Poisson structure is found.",-0.15559867,0.11725873,0.17103572,-0.103315264,-0.15352301,0.13653073,-0.12662248,0.041310605,0.3239284,-0.2624281,0.07454992,0.10741713,0.016422782,-0.23550656,0.039579004,0.23734792,0.21460482,-0.317921,-0.4006935,0.04469376,0.0138686,0.10755846,0.36321032,-0.101426736,0.024715953,0.4019338,0.14074335,0.001499881,-0.05599221,0.011280805,0.087889254,-0.07321209,-0.11948293,-0.47369334,0.0056236982,0.008411512,-0.24549854,0.107163504,0.15187931,-0.24653934,-0.12516361,0.018518433,0.043016948,-0.10015643,0.03628303,-0.2429334,-0.1672197,0.46046466,-0.16412273,0.10973166,0.1127787,-0.05936636,0.098733395,-0.066329725,-0.18204162,0.112460405,-0.27537668,-0.24687505,0.37754008,-0.0726444,0.12649989,-0.39963293,0.006778854,-0.017415866,0.29046464,0.10540911,-0.018878467,0.033109814,-0.122970134,-0.056448698,0.020959115,0.18496154,0.29781476,0.14292441,0.003511034,0.27657908,0.07176726,0.15476409,-0.30976874,-0.2772538,0.074364156,-0.45346025,-0.03385248,0.16191922,0.23350932,0.08096531,-0.10866116,-0.16674545,0.17042214,-0.037583135,-0.13108909,0.09155128,-0.1952141,0.0040320326,0.057268478,0.18539509,0.07250996,-0.24002482,0.0080491975,0.22923867,-0.05819671,-0.2485283,-0.38396448,-0.00033007562,-0.22534949,-0.21307631,-0.23074068,-0.11928044,0.03280674,-0.049025655,0.24863836,-0.09461065,0.2030184,-0.38215813,-0.39938417,-0.004551396,0.3111344,0.18787535,0.0065589026,-0.2307857,-0.072734796,-0.020591319,0.22076465,0.3336907,-0.03447926,-0.087503225,0.17222705,0.2425006

quantization of symplectic manifolds is presented. To lowest order in Planck's

one form belonging to the exterior algebra of the Weyl algebra bundle

naturally lead to the Moyal Plebanski equations, furnishing Moyal deformations
of self dual gravitational backgrounds associated with the complexified

9505073,1995,"Certain four-dimensional $N=4$ supersymmetric theories have special vacua in
which massive charged vector supermultiplets become massless, resulting in an
enhanced non-abelian gauge symmetry. We show here that any two $N=4$ theories
having the same Bogomolnyi spectrum at corresponding points of their moduli
spaces have the same enhanced symmetry groups. In particular, the $K_3\times
T^2$ compactified type II string is argued to have the same enhanced symmetry
groups as the $T^6$-compactified heterotic string, giving further evidence for
our conjecture that these two string theories are equivalent. A feature of the
enhanced symmetry phase is that for every electrically charged state whose mass
tends to zero as an enhanced symmetry point is approached, there are
magnetically charged and dyonic states whose masses also tend to zero, a result
that applies equally to N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. These extra
non-perturbative massless states in the $K_3$ compactification result from
$p$-branes wrapping around collapsed homology two-cycles of $K_3$. Finally, we
show how membrane `wrapping modes' lead to symmetry enhancement in D=11
supergravity, providing further evidence that the $K_3$-compactified D=11
supergravity is the effective field theory of the strong coupling limit of the
$T^3$-compactified heterotic string.",-0.12308482,-0.13204221,-0.1459932,0.011401564,-0.03347921,0.11815554,-0.016929865,-0.13516468,-0.06124538,0.20371002,0.22122717,-0.29301503,-0.16464081,-0.17630844,0.07266076,-0.05006945,-0.0577669,0.14136481,0.17471674,-0.08700652,0.0077228993,0.19875056,0.080998294,-0.23454043,-0.079429284,0.04535858,0.17950442,-0.15067138,-0.15544418,0.028231561,-0.09068743,-0.027157996,0.029985175,-0.07301524,-0.21003675,0.07292403,-0.01453045,-0.14716083,0.04199167,0.10493913,-0.093100995,0.05896809,0.07695176,0.17424512,-0.28952444,-0.12686592,0.17401409,-0.17010781,0.16023004,0.28803462,-0.08333363,-0.037044417,-0.09480585,-0.1233599,0.22853081,-0.13764016,-0.19966571,-0.073867515,0.39729166,-0.05517515,0.1432024,0.004212871,-0.014945362,-0.17497897,0.0748823,-0.01687812,-0.28802815,-0.09493682,0.317028,-0.04458791,-0.00417801,0.15788265,0.042564526,-0.1814883,0.08376002,-0.07902189,0.32534486,0.13507667,-0.035542298,0.11743049,-0.13623351,-0.14437719,-0.07326603,0.05962348,0.025921032,0.13182697,0.04415888,-0.0427721,0.06540848,0.07046707,0.2461013,0.03103996,0.06680751,-0.0814699,0.1582301,-0.18966533,0.029744703,-0.1543822,-0.010681383,-0.051972672,-0.046548165,0.29351035,-0.030649617,0.11439875,-0.1579631,-0.12748858,-0.11809492,-0.14421216,-0.07653362,-0.15744318,0.051388986,-0.0151168,0.034305945,-0.0017269701,-0.024212487,0.062468983,-0.001949152,0.036150545,-0.052070588,-0.047188185,-0.21633139,-0.024562716,-0.20548394,0.012574043,-0.089364626,-0.16150717,-0.07774023,-0.2122024

9412056,1994,"We start with the observation that the quantum group SL_q(2), described in
terms of its algebra of functions has a quantum subgroup, which is just a usual
Cartan group.
   Based on this observation we develop a general method of constructing
quantum groups with similar property. We also describe this method in the
language of quantized universal enveloping algebras, which is another common
method of studying quantum groups.
   We carry our method in detail for root systems of type SL(2); as a byproduct
we find a new series of quantum groups - metaplectic groups of SL(2)-type.
Representations of these groups can provide interesting examples of bimodule

black hole formation and the subsequent Hawking radiation by neglecting
complication due to a finite curvature. We extend this approach to dynamically
treat back reaction against the mirror motion due to Hawking radiation. It is
found that a unique model in two spacetime dimensions exists in which Hawking
radiation completely stops and the end point of evaporation contains a
disconnected remnant. When viewed from asymptotic observers at one side of the
spacetime, quantum mechanical correlation is recovered in the end. Although the
thermal stage accompanying short range correlation may last for an arbitrarily

the coupling is chosen to be imaginary. These nevertheless carry real energy

equivalence is shown to follow from a surprising identity satisfied within the

9709216,1997,"A direct link between a one-loop N-point Feynman diagram and a geometrical
representation based on the N-dimensional simplex is established by relating
the Feynman parametric representations to the integrals over contents of
(N-1)-dimensional simplices in non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature. In
particular, the four-point function in four dimensions is proportional to the
volume of a three-dimensional spherical (or hyperbolic) tetrahedron which can
be calculated by splitting into birectangular ones. It is also shown that the

Quantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the light-cone
momentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of 1/K.
Solutions to the DLCQ bound state equations are obtained for K=2,3 and 4 by
discretizing the light-cone super charges, which preserves supersymmetry
manifestly. We discuss degeneracies in the massive spectrum that appear to be

interpreted as unifying ``string field theory'' for $c < 1$ minimal series
coupled to 2d gravity. The problem of interpolation between different models is
discussed. It is found that this problem is closely connected with

abelian case the approaches of Buscher, and Ro\u{c}ek and Verlinde are
reviewed. Buscher's prescription for the dilaton transformation is recovered
from a careful definition of the gauge integration measure. It is also shown
how duality can be understood as a quite simple canonical transformation. Some
aspects of non-abelian duality are also discussed, in particular what is known

9601075,1996,"The point of this paper is see what light new results in hyperbolic geometry
may throw on gravitational entropy and whether gravitational entropy is
relevant for the quantum origin of the univeres. We introduce some new
gravitational instantons which mediate the birth from nothing of closed
universes containing wormholes and suggest that they may contribute to the
density matrix of the universe. We also discuss the connection between their
gravitational action and the topological and volumetric entropies introduced in
hyperbolic geometry. These coincide for hyperbolic 4-manifolds, and increase
with increasing topological complexity of the four manifold. We raise the
questions of whether the action also increases with the topological complexity
of the initial 3-geometry, measured either by its three volume or its Matveev
complexity. We point out, in distinction to the non-supergravity case,
that universes with domains of negative cosmological constant separated by
supergravity domain walls cannot be born from nothing. Finally we point out
that our wormholes provide examples of the type of Perpetual Motion machines

situations.
  First the behavior of a compact 1-dimensional universe (i.e. like a closed
string) is classified on the assumption of homogeneity of universe.
  Several interesting solutions are found, which include a Misner-type universe
having closed time-like curves, and an asymptotically de Sitter universe first
pointed out by Yoshimura.
  In the second half of this talk, we discuss the modification of the classical
homogeneous solutions, considering inhomogeneity of classical conformal matters

9509070,1995,"Recently a great deal of evidence has been found indicating that type IIA
string theory compactified on K3 is equivalent to heterotic string theory
compactified on T^4. Under the transformation which relates the two theories,
the roles of fundamental and solitonic string solutions are interchanged. In
this letter we show that there exists a solitonic membrane solution of the
heterotic string theory which becomes a singular solution of the type IIA

cubic lattice is represented by a very simple quantum cellular automaton. In
each evolution step the updated value of the wave function at a given site

preserves chiral symmetry. Moreover, it is shown that the relationship between
Dirac particles and cellular automata operating on two component objects on a

9706036,1997,"The canonical front form Hamiltonian for non-Abelian SU(N) gauge theory in
3+1 dimensions is mapped non-perturbatively on an effective Hamiltonian which
acts only in the Fock space of a quark and an antiquark. The approach is based
on the novel method of iterated resolvents and on discretized light-cone
quantization, driven to the continuum limit. It is free of the usual
Tamm-Dancoff truncations of the Fock space, rather the perturbative series are
consistently resumed to all orders in the coupling constant. Emphasis is put on
dealing with the many-body aspects of gauge field theory. The effective
interaction turns out to be the kernel of an integral equation in the momentum
space of a single quark, which is frame-independent and solvable on
comparatively small computers. Important is that the higher Fock-space
amplitudes can be retrieved self-consistently from these solutions.",0.16886187,0.08379194,-0.07015318,0.7934272,-0.050841242,-0.1815629,-0.0040546805,0.36944932,0.01759363,-0.41728902,-0.28447372,0.18655154,0.4198374,0.43413886,-0.09752712,-0.042329565,0.23365547,-0.3624189,-0.45131156,0.6502018,0.293694,-0.2942652,-0.12095122,-0.22192821,-0.13869794,-0.1507681,-0.29533127,0.4056952,-0.025956586,0.47879654,0.022392655,-0.10484175,-0.5179833,-0.1765355,0.01833225,0.16088036,-0.29487556,-0.35321224,0.53681743,-0.037224073,-0.031304955,-0.17308909,0.05962115,0.38035992,-0.2309359,0.08319206,0.20529726,0.26612958,-0.23232636,-0.23952346,-0.07181552,-0.124116346,0.12465271,0.48478147,0.41255414,0.6293849,-0.22037715,0.03707532,-0.15059382,0.37713826,0.051264167,0.041521393,-0.17563984,-0.19995981,0.10266087,-0.103207976,-0.40034166,0.10765113,-0.3336864,0.32999325,-0.14725502,-0.4658299,-0.3089605,-0.16691482,-0.19977348,-0.15085196,0.32131007,0.008638769,0.2413522,-0.22103578,-0.2801953,0.036876574,0.116413414,-0.03302279,-0.24592066,0.24163707,-0.21786064,0.40151882,-0.10656376,-0.11744869,-0.096998855,-0.15049815,0.30077788,-0.04654941,-0.18323763,0.26251692,0.09201806,-0.49546218,0.3405457,0.2879582,-0.11005967,-0.25791395,0.32271397,0.31669438,-0.47101033,-0.206697,-0.003251806,-0.2030914,0.19968477,0.18805811,0.07801147,-0.16990992,-0.65034306,0.5243286,0.038424492,-0.4965245,-0.2971325,0.42120957,0.47756594,0.24615239,0.19101219,-0.18532245,0.05043021,0.21027559,-0.36466652,-0.18611261,-0.22208863,-0.07933481

the six-dimensional heterotic string compactification constructed recently by

Poincar\'e gauge theory are presented. It is shown that the Hamiltonian is
given as a linear combination of ten first class constraints. The Poisson

9506065,1995,"In this review I discuss various aspects of some of the recently constructed
black hole and soliton solutions in string theory. I begin with the axionic
instanton and related solutions of bosonic and heterotic string theory. The
latter ten-dimensional solutions can be compactified to supersymmetric
monopole, string and domain wall solutions which break $1/2$ of the spacetime
supersymmetries of $N=4, D=4$ heterotic string theory, and which can be
generalized to two-parameter charged black hole solutions. The low-energy
dynamics of these solutions is also discussed, as well as their connections
with strong/weak coupling duality and target space duality in string theory.
Finally, new solutions are presented which break $3/4, 7/8$ and all of the
spacetime supersymmetries and which also arise in more realistic $N=1$ and
$N=2$ compactifications.",-0.35281822,-0.110620454,0.0068117213,-0.3360372,0.09982805,0.27251154,-0.057370737,-0.23989382,-0.090056166,0.0030150414,-0.35881883,0.015046224,-0.015772525,-0.41590118,-0.0068024024,-0.23729838,-0.085892454,-0.3958575,0.08004949,0.062340055,0.018382229,0.1759478,-0.041581213,0.019816387,0.029457845,0.22643271,0.13764665,-0.114791766,-0.13468695,-0.0063063353,-0.06568234,-0.26113147,-0.2858312,0.17414871,-0.0784402,-0.10063759,0.0046479255,-0.033948623,0.042798974,-0.05189328,-0.22775537,-0.27913618,-0.28640607,0.29796192,-0.08295802,0.21283783,0.13121414,-0.0025016852,0.16633415,0.031435214,-0.04560589,-0.18721348,-0.05766037,-0.27521056,-0.06025656,-0.06640321,-0.052263856,-0.091059595,0.051710993,-0.0633975,0.0603161,0.21497868,-0.15352277,0.35348675,0.028088994,-0.1274622,-0.0731863,0.13916564,-0.15117066,-0.07980463,-0.1452788,0.17262134,-0.016988263,-0.058799855,0.09549381,0.068975314,0.112478286,0.13608494,-0.07461647,-0.056106083,0.112072706,-0.026196763,0.31906676,0.03173177,-0.0028362274,0.1308325,-0.09005295,0.2789079,-0.084475696,-0.04568553,-0.21883544,0.09087295,0.07963021,-0.13066952,-0.15812045,-0.037959542,-0.2181336,-0.03422752,0.0053266734,-0.03737206,0.021078024,-0.23034778,-0.18258978,0.10457017,-0.15901032,-0.02861639,-0.19149345,-0.24581155,-0.015502907,-0.21156144,0.121287845,-0.21397889,0.15391047,-0.15385695,0.124671906,-0.023987398,-0.011410713,-0.14831135,-0.0867375,0.37212455,0.10209275,-0.041985698,-0.00017346442,-0.09124452,-0.09901181,-0.03985116,0.13478993,0.02786085

9607234,1996,"This paper provides a systematic description of the interplay between a
specific class of reductions denoted as \cKPrm ($r,m \geq 1$) of the primary
continuum integrable system -- the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili ({\sf KP}) hierarchy
and discrete multi-matrix models. The relevant integrable \cKPrm structure is a
generalization of the familiar $r$-reduction of the full {\sf KP} hierarchy to
the $SL(r)$ generalized KdV hierarchy ${\sf cKP}_{r,0}$. The important feature
of \cKPrm hierarchies is the presence of a discrete symmetry structure
generated by successive Darboux-B\""{a}cklund (DB) transformations. This
symmetry allows for expressing the relevant tau-functions as Wronskians within
a formalism which realizes the tau-functions as DB orbits of simple initial
solutions. In particular, it is shown that any DB orbit of a ${\sf cKP}_{r,1}$
defines a generalized 2-dimensional Toda lattice structure. Furthermore, we
consider the class of truncated {\sf KP} hierarchies ({\sl i.e.}, those defined
via Wilson-Sato dressing operator with a finite truncated pseudo-differential
series) and establish explicitly their close relationship with DB orbits of
\cKPrm hierarchies. This construction is relevant for finding partition
functions of the discrete multi-matrix models.
  The next important step involves the reformulation of the familiar
non-isospectral additional symmetries of the full {\sf KP} hierarchy so that
their action on \cKPrm hierarchies becomes consistent with the constraints of
the reduction. Moreover, we show that the correct modified additional
symmetries are compatible with the discrete DB symmetry on the \cKPrm DB
orbits.
  The above technical arsenal is subsequently applied to obtain complete",-0.26865304,0.039315924,-0.17548789,-0.078587115,0.033724125,0.23099215,-0.22249976,-0.45621005,0.060466398,0.24414438,-0.09643719,0.015211076,-0.40970933,-0.020235807,0.30314064,-0.15100852,-0.2985247,-0.20351653,-0.14017862,-0.11185619,-0.017294511,0.2842182,-0.18296632,-0.1890283,-0.14109805,0.054687493,0.32295534,0.06283447,-0.42349267,0.013432115,-0.2591435,-0.05755483,-0.3234915,0.33168653,0.17337021,0.1296292,0.098802015,-0.41513038,-0.08820085,0.021855667,-0.06747575,-0.3077089,0.07121654,-0.15222564,-0.26012954,0.036349412,0.31324017,-0.22981183,0.13316324,0.099693224,0.0031236038,-0.096609265,0.038134545,0.12712096,0.12067959,-0.006628491,-0.19457683,0.17424761,0.3207774,0.12828127,-0.14367299,0.2727939,-0.064773045,0.14248592,0.10190286,-0.112906106,-0.09476436,-0.19759774,0.049148846,-0.08916555,0.0034336406,-0.06459528,0.137579,0.13041195,-0.04650195,-0.31761384,0.445531,-0.21681543,-0.465801,0.62878597,0.20191927,-0.1556901,0.23491512,0.0787985,-0.27474147,0.20709601,-0.32826194,0.36021432,0.014505826,-0.030518658,-0.078433625,0.08336574,-0.26944658,0.29628798,0.30539265,-0.18487279,0.0044353455,0.2806736,-0.023787603,-0.07022752,-0.031419672,0.32670042,0.24817972,-0.2089183,0.1705363,0.037573934,0.04541748,0.2774182,0.1318722,-0.05930069,0.11950137,0.0569362,0.10201098,0.18203776,-0.44364506,0.2740487,0.20805484,0.023192853,0.062453806,-0.41626155,-0.052090608,0.24817385,-0.049971566,0.17943893,0.054921072,0.03611818,0.023304567,-0.119123556

9407148,1994,"The question of the integrability of real-coupling affine toda field theory
on a half line is discussed. It is shown, by examining low-spin conserved
charges, that the boundary conditions preserving integrability are strongly
constrained. In particular, among the cases treated so far, $e_6^{(1)}$,
$d_n^{(1)}$ and $a_n^{(1)}, \ n\ge 2$, there can be no free parameters
introduced by such boundary conditions; indeed the only remaining freedom
(apart from choosing the simple condition $\partial_1\phi =0$), resides in a
choice of signs. For a special case of the boundary condition, accessible only
for $a_n^{(1)}$, it is pointed out that the classical boundary bound state
spectrum may be related to a set of reflection factors in the quantum field
theory. Some preliminary calculations are reported for other boundary
conditions, demonstrating that the classical scattering data satisfies the weak
coupling limit of the reflection bootstrap equation. (Invited talk at \lq

the worldvolume theories of D5-branes suspended between networks of NS5-branes,
the so-called brane box models. In this paper, we derive the stringy
consistency conditions placed on these models, and show that they are
equivalent to anomaly cancellation of the gauge theories. We derive these
conditions in the orbifold theories which are T-dual to the elliptic brane box
models. Specifically, we show that the expression for tadpoles for unphysical
twisted Ramond-Ramond 4-form fields in the orbifold theory are proportional to
the gauge anomalies of the brane box theory. Thus string consistency is
equivalent to worldvolume gauge anomaly cancellation. Furthermore, we find
additional cylinder amplitudes which give the $\beta$-functions of the gauge
theory. We show how these correspond to bending of the NS-branes in the brane
box theory.",-0.086070895,0.02056068,-0.2121874,-0.12591836,-0.22567804,0.1760238,-0.089397855,0.15908116,-0.007879838,0.15041597,-0.043231115,0.07804452,0.05844609,-0.037762776,0.07676005,0.043135658,-0.10780317,0.120188855,0.050008483,0.12896284,-0.101149045,0.12775174,0.14925487,0.15161398,-0.10561889,-0.042581998,0.06066888,0.06075367,0.07636747,-0.020136505,0.04305781,-0.20943859,-0.03095144,0.06723833,0.11586734,-0.26205915,-0.03641557,-0.10547947,0.088821664,-0.038831145,-0.278529,-0.07112831,-0.021625098,-0.17001177,0.0129561275,0.01750464,0.23487939,0.10948018,0.112921074,0.2787896,0.058655124,-0.0002310276,0.17598906,-0.07683655,-0.057542324,-0.20536569,0.011932362,-0.14158234,0.11993083,-0.14947577,0.05993583,0.17828467,-0.044356994,-0.012626307,-0.16254804,-0.20953806,-0.17704675,0.002032265,0.018606365,-0.15617137,0.17348413,0.22015938,0.0055996925,-0.18985549,0.089108676,0.18567419,0.024644524,-0.001096718,0.014781781,0.16624716,0.061214987,0.05470635,0.19436356,0.041865677,0.26599413,0.12904549,0.062762745,-0.13725887,0.01583907,-0.019082129,-0.09654363,0.11181784,0.12891269,-0.027741633,0.08009855,-0.10675253,-0.19668916,0.048945278,0.14254215,-0.28885755,-0.15709153,0.22948913,0.2556948,0.10459988,-0.036040477,-0.11963997,-0.15054676,0.049410507,0.0047714785,-0.13825092,-0.16600463,-0.05608537,0.38850522,0.12557332,0.083752975,-0.19895121,-0.18385163,0.03060767,-0.22810078,-0.14720716,-0.2346197,-0.14366817,0.050965667,-0.19072787,-0.20108446,0.10134841,0.1929473,0.18177564

fractional flux in low dimensional orientifolds is examined. It is argued that
gravitational couplings need to be assigned not only to D-branes but also to
orientifold planes. The fractional charges of the orientifold $d$-planes can be
understood in terms of flux quantization of the $d-3$ form potential and

9301043,1993,"We use mirror symmetry to establish the first concrete arena of spacetime
topology change in string theory. In particular, we establish that the

by rephrasing the description of these nonlinear sigma models in terms of their
mirror manifold partners---a description in which the full quantum theory can
be described exactly using lowest order geometrical methods.
   We establish that, for the known class of mirror manifolds, the moduli space

<X(\al,g_m)$ is satisfied, where $\al$ is a flux in the units of the flux
quantum, $g_m$ is magnetic moment, and $X(\al,g_m)$ is some function that is
nonzero only for $g_m>2$ (note that $g_m=2.00232$ for the electron), then the
matter is unstable against formation of the flux $\al$. The result persists
down to $g_m=2$ provided the Aharonov-Bohm potential is supplemented with a
short range attractive potential. We also show that whenever a bound state is
present in the spectrum it is always accompanied by a resonance with the energy
proportional to the absolute value of the binding energy. is considered.
  For the Klein-Gordon equation with the Pauli coupling which exists in (2+1)
dimensions without any reference to a spin the matter is again unstable for
$g_m>2$. The results are obtained by calculating the change of the density of
states induced by the Aharonov-Bohm potential. The Krein-Friedel formula for
this long-ranged potential is shown to be valid when supplemented with zeta

9701087,1997,"By applying an inverse Landau-Khalatnikov transformation, connecting
(resummed) Schwinger-Dyson treatments in non-local and Landau gauges of
$QED_3$, we derive the infrared behaviour of the wave-function renormalization
in the Landau gauge, and the associated critical exponents in the normal phase
of the theory (no mass generation). The result agrees with the one conjectured
in earlier treatments. The analysis involves an approximation, namely an
expansion of the non-local gauge in powers of momenta in the infrared. This
approximation is tested by reproducing the critical number of flavours
necessary for dynamical mass generation in the chiral-symmetry-broken phase of

9606122,1996,"We study the restrictions imposed by cancellation of the tadpoles for two,
three, and four-form gauge fields in string theory, M-theory and F-theory
compactified to two, three and four dimensions, respectively. For a large class
of supersymmetric vacua, turning on a sufficient number of strings, membranes
and three-branes, respectively, can cancel the tadpoles, and preserve
supersymmetry. However, there are cases where the tadpole cannot be removed in

the running coupling, enter directly into the loop expansion. In the case of an

9403014,1994,"A mechanism of supersymmetry breaking in two or four-dimensions is given, in
which the breaking is related to the Fermat's last theorem. It is shown that
supersymmetry is exact at some irrational number points in parameter space,
while it is broken at all rational number points except for the origin.
Accordingly, supersymmetry is exact {\it almost everywhere}, as well as broken
{\it almost everywhere} on the real axis in the parameter space at the same
time. This is the first explicit mechanism of supersymmetry breaking with an
arbitrarily small change of parameters around any exact supersymmetric model,
which is possibly useful for realistically small non-perturbative supersymmetry
breakings in superstring model building. As a byproduct, we also give a
convenient superpotential for supersymmetry breaking only for irrational number
parameters. Our superpotential can be added as a ``hidden'' sector to other
useful supersymmetric models.",-0.11226084,0.18318728,-0.036616065,0.28463396,0.17710608,-0.05465106,0.1662013,-0.13797362,-0.27291587,-0.1186398,0.084464654,-0.017465498,-0.047064196,0.0438023,-0.21064954,-0.07491939,0.10548714,-0.0655176,0.04453965,0.1708695,-0.27213943,-0.13928829,-0.06806044,-0.17355552,-0.14841646,-0.038547374,-0.13741955,-0.23416458,0.11811804,-0.034174427,0.2799098,0.039463352,-0.077149376,0.14841308,0.04508347,0.11575784,0.0749462,0.23414972,-0.1799578,-0.020244416,0.15464944,0.38308418,-0.2350173,-0.17228375,0.091990806,0.20116445,-0.19182074,0.049230877,0.18384308,0.025047706,-0.05968057,0.11041984,-0.15259455,-0.12415172,-0.07911637,-0.21752632,-0.04868073,0.22025104,-0.09144238,-0.11050001,0.11757222,-0.084867746,0.21298046,-0.18799548,-0.08713074,-0.12621514,0.16501145,-0.30762774,0.2025757,-0.18448782,-0.009702634,-0.050049685,0.016250081,0.043423153,0.1909648,0.0022952817,-0.34107417,-0.0387185,0.31065708,-0.2131511,-0.070563674,0.049735766,0.040225014,-0.28633398,-0.28345323,0.0401629,-0.14157021,-0.016263459,0.18213618,0.058838163,0.091092184,0.054937534,-0.014260173,0.13856652,0.09422404,-0.3055442,0.038807742,0.13312367,-0.040657073,0.12682526,-0.09130691,-0.03665078,-0.23122698,0.48898464,-0.112518035,-0.02036243,0.089448795,-0.06350857,-0.12262848,0.31857482,-0.29153994,-0.08715212,-0.071120776,0.11778197,0.22981617,0.31071064,-0.19056563,-0.15617912,0.03196138,0.034981586,0.03833562,-0.12047192,0.13678677,-0.09832138,0.19455326,0.021641275,0.028106816,0.096832186
