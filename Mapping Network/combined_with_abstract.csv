equivalent to the extension of time ordered distributions to coincident points.
This is achieved by a modified Taylor subtraction on the corresponding test
functions. I show that the pullback of this operation to the distributions
yields expressions known from Differential Renormalization. The subtraction is
equivalent to BPHZ subtraction in momentum space. Some examples from Euclidean
scalar field theory in flat and curved spacetime will be presented."

for the 2D system describing the motion of a charged spin-1/2 particle in an
external magnetic field. The universal algebraic structure underlying the
holomorphic $n$-supersymmetry is found. It is shown that the essential
difference of the 2D realization of the holomorphic $n$-supersymmetry from the
1D case recently analysed by us consists in appearance of the central charge
entering non-trivially into the superalgebra. The relation of the 2D
holomorphic $n$-supersymmetry to the 1D quasi-exactly solvable (QES) problems
is demonstrated by means of the reduction of the systems with hyperbolic or
trigonometric form of the magnetic field. The reduction of the
$n$-supersymmetric system with the polynomial magnetic field results in the
family of the one- dimensional QES systems with the sextic potential. Unlike
the original 2D holomorphic supersymmetry, the reduced 1D supersymmetry
associated with $x^6+...$ family is characterized by the non-holomorphic
supercharges of the special form found by Aoyama et al."

dimensions, endowed with an invariant UV cut-off $\Lambda$, and containing a
large number $N$ of non-self-interacting matter species, the physical gauge and
gravitational couplings at the cut-off, $\alpha_g \equiv g^2 \Lambda^{D-4}$ and
$\alpha_G \equiv G_N \Lambda^{D-2}$, are shown to be bounded by appropriate
powers of ${1\over N}$. This implies that the infinite-bare-coupling (so-called

compactification of D=11 supergravity. This rescaled N^{010} space is of

the harmonic interaction admit a new class of bound and scattering states.
These states owe their existence to the self-adjoint extensions of the
corresponding Hamiltonians, labelled by a real parameter z. It is shown that
the new states appear for all values of N and for specific ranges of the
coupling constants. Moreover, they are shown to exist even in the excited
sectors of the Calogero models. The self-adjoint extension generically breaks
the classical scaling symmetry, leading to quantum mechanical scaling anomaly.
The scaling symmetry can however be restored for certain values of the
parameter z. We also generalize these results for many particle systems with
classically scale invariant long range interactions in arbitrary dimensions."

covariant gauges. Following an earlier suggestion, an equivariant
BRST-construction is used to define the continuum theory on a finite torus. The
equivariant gauge fixing introduces constant ghost fields as moduli of the
model. We study the parameter- and moduli- space perturbatively. For $n_f \leq
n$ quark flavors, the moduli flow to a non-trivial fixed point in certain
critical covariant gauges and the one-loop effective potential indicates that
the global SU(n) color symmetry of the gauge fixed model is spontaneously
broken to $U(1)^{n-1}$. Ward identities and renormalization group arguments
imply that the longitudinal gauge boson propagator at long range is dominated
by $n(n-1)$ Goldstone bosons in these critical covariant gauges. In the large
$n$ limit, we derive a nonlinear integral equation for the expectation value of
large Wilson loops assuming that the exchange of Goldstone bosons dominates the
interaction at long range in critical covariant gauges. We find numerically
that the expectation value of large circular Wilson loops decreases
exponentially with the enclosed area in the absence of dynamical fermions. The
gauge invariance of this mechanism for confinement in critical covariant gauges
is discussed."

supergravity of the form R^{1,9-n} x M_n with non-trivial NS flux and dilaton.
Solutions of this type arise naturally as the near-horizon limits of wrapped NS
fivebrane geometries. We concentrate on the case d=7, preserving two or four
supersymmetries, corresponding to branes wrapped on associative or SLAG
three-cycles. Given the existence of Killing spinors, we show that M_7 admits a
G_2-structure or an SU(3)-structure, respectively, of specific type. We also
prove the converse result. We use the existence of these geometric structures
as a new technique to derive some known and new explicit solutions, as well as
a simple theorem implying that we have vanishing NS three-form and constant
dilaton whenever M_7 is compact with no boundary. The analysis extends simply
to other type II examples and also to type I supergravity."

string theory. In particular, it imposes stringent constraints on the spectrum
of orbifold theories, and in principle determines their spectrum uniquely up to
discrete torsion classes. In practice, however, there are often ambiguities in
the construction of orbifolds that are a consequence of the fact that the
action of the orbifold elements on degenerate ground states is not unambiguous.
We explain that there exists an additional consistency condition, related to
the spectrum of D-branes in the theory, which eliminates these ambiguities. For
supersymmetric orbifolds this condition turns out to be equivalent to the
condition that supersymmetry is unbroken in the twisted sectors, but for
non-supersymmetric orbifolds it appears to be a genuinely new consistency
condition."

Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory. For the case of a BPS
D3-brane probing the Klebanov-Strassler warped deformed conifold, the cosmology
described by a suitable brane observer is a bouncing, spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with time-varying Newton's constant, which
passes smoothly from a contracting to an expanding phase. In the
Klebanov-Tseytlin approximation to the Klebanov-Strassler solution the
cosmology would end with a big crunch singularity. In this sense, the warped
deformed conifold provides a string theory resolution of a spacelike
singularity in the brane cosmology. The four-dimensional effective action
appropriate for a brane observer is a simple scalar-tensor theory of gravity.

the necessary elements to formulate M(atrix) theory on this new

theories in 2+1 dimensions, by compactifying dual pairs on a circle of radius R

compactification scale, the theory on the Higgs branch reduces to the
non-linear sigma model on a toric manifold. In the dual theory on the Coulomb
branch, the Kaluza-Klein modes generate an infinite tower of contributions to
the superpotential. After resummation, in the limit R->0 the superpotential
becomes that of the Landau-Ginzburg model which is the two-dimensional mirror
of the toric sigma model. We further examine the conjecture of all-scale
three-dimensional mirror symmetry and observe that it is consistent with mirror
symmetry in 1+1 dimensions."

obtained by gauging some of the isometries of the manifold spanned by the
scalars of vector and hypermultiplets. We first consider the case obtained by
compactifying M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold in the presence of G-fluxes.
It is found that supersymmetry allows for the construction of domain wall
configurations with curved worldvolume and a cosmological constant. However it
turns out that the equations of motion, if one insists on the supersymmetric
ansatz for the scalars and warp factor, rule out solutions with a cosmological
constant and allows only for Ricci-flat worldvolumes. Moreover, in the absence
of flux, there are non-supersymmetric solutions with worldvolumes given by
Einstein manifolds. We also generalize our results to all five dimensional
gauged supergravity."

cosmological horizons. By considering the perturbations of the metric in these
geometries we establish that their horizons are unstable in the sense that an
observer trying to cross the horizon experiences an infinite flux of radiation
at the instant of crossing. The backreaction of this radiation is likely to
convert the horizons into curvature singularities, similar to the instability
of the internal Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We also
compute the particle production by the time-dependent fields in the future
regions of these geometries, and find that the spectrum of produced particles
is thermal, with temperature coinciding with the Hawking temperature computed
by euclideanizing the metric in the static region. Possible implications of
these results are discussed."

A-brane composites in Calabi-Yau compactifications. This allows for the
construction of a holomorphic potential describing the low-energy dynamics of
such systems, which generalizes the superpotentials known from the ungraded
case. Upon using results of homotopy algebra, we show that the string field and
low energy descriptions of the moduli space agree, and that the deformations of
such backgrounds are described by a certain extended version of `off-shell
Massey products' associated with flat graded superbundles. As examples, we
consider a class of graded D-brane pairs of unit relative grade. Upon computing
the holomorphic potential, we study their moduli space of composites. In
particular, we give a general proof that such pairs can form acyclic
condensates, and, for a particular case, show that another branch of their
moduli space describes condensation of a two-form."

in type II superstring theory coupled to constant background fields. In
particular, within this setting we determine the complete expression for the
(disk level) four-derivative corrections to the Born-Infeld part of the action.
We also determine 2n-form 2n-derivative corrections to the Wess-Zumino term.
Both types of corrections involve all orders of the gauge field strength, F.
The results are obtained via string sigma-model loop calculations using the
boundary state operator language. The corrections can be succinctly written in
terms of the Riemann tensor for a non-symmetric metric."

suggested that the coefficient of the Euler characteristic in the trace anomaly
could measure the degrees of freedom in field theory and decrease along the
renormalization-group flow. We compute this quantity for free massless scalar,
fermion and antisymmetric tensor fields in any dimension, and analyse its
dependence on spin and space-time dimension. In the limit of large number of
dimensions, where the theories become semiclassical, we find that this quantity
does not approach the classical number of field components, but is enhanced for
spinful particles. This seemingly strange behaviour is found to be consistent
with known renormalization-group patterns and a specific c-theorem conjecture."

orbifold are discussed, using a $(-1)^{F_L}\sigma_{1/2}$ projection, where
$F_L$ is the leftmoving space-time fermion number and $\sigma_{1/2}$ is a
freely acting shift of order two. There are two types of non BPS D branes,
which are stable at $R>2$ and $R<2$ respectively. At R=2 there is a
perturbative enhancement of gauge symmetry and the two types of branes are
related by a global bulk symmetry transformation. At this point in the moduli
space the associated boundary states are constructed using a free fermion

theory, as found by Gross in the large N limit, using the 1/N expansion. Later
it was found that even a generalized YM theory leads to a string theory of the
Gross type. In the standard YM theory case, Douglas and others found the string
hamiltonian describing the propagation and the interactions of states made of
strings winding on a cylindrical space-time. We address the problem of finding
a similar hamiltonian for the generalized YM theory. As in the standard case we
start by writing the theory as a theory of free fermions. Performing a
bosonization, we express the hamiltonian in terms of the modes of a bosonic
field, that are interpreted as in the standard case as creation and destruction
operators for states of strings winding around the cylindrical space-time. The
result is similar to the standard hamiltonian, but with new kinds of
interaction vertices."

``asymptotic past triviality'', by which we mean that the initial state is a
generic perturbative solution of the tree-level low-energy effective action.
Such a past-trivial ``string vacuum'' is made of an arbitrary ensemble of
incoming gravitational and dilatonic waves, and is generically prone to
gravitational instability, leading to the possible formation of many black
holes hiding singular space-like hypersurfaces. Each such singular space-like
hypersurface of gravitational collapse becomes, in the string-frame metric, the
usual big-bang t=0 hypersurface, i.e. the place of birth of a baby Friedmann
universe after a period of dilaton-driven inflation. Specializing to the
spherically-symmetric case, we review and reinterpret previous work on the
subject, and propose a simple, scale-invariant criterion for collapse/inflation
in terms of asymptotic data at past null infinity. Those data should determine
whether, when, and where collapse/inflation occurs, and, when it does, fix its
characteristics, including anisotropies on the big bang hypersurface whose
imprint could have survived till now. Using Bayesian probability concepts, we

The study developed here is applied in two different dual models. First, we
discuss the case of a two-dimensional oscillator interacting with an

models. Examples of the single-state multiplets were established previously in
N=1 Landau-Ginzburg models. The shortening comes at a price of loosing the
fermion parity $(-1)^F$ due to boundary effects. This implies the disappearance
of the boson-fermion classification resulting in abnormal statistics. To count
such short multiplets we introduce a new index. We consider the phenomenon of
shortening in a broad class of hybrid models which extend the Landau-Ginzburg
models to include a nonflat metric on the target space. Our index turns out to
be related to the index of the Dirac operator on the soliton moduli space. The
latter vanishes in most cases implying the absence of shortening. We also
generalize the anomaly in the central charge to take into account the target
space metric."

extends to a genuine superconductivity in dimensions higher than one. The
mechanism is based on the fact that a point-like topological soliton carries an
electric charge. We discuss a flux quantization mechanism and show that it is
essentially a generalization of the persistent current phenomenon, known in
quantum wires. We also discuss why the superconducting state is stable in the
presence of a weak disorder."

models is studied on the two--sphere $S^{2}$. The conflict between the loss of
gauge invariance and global geometrical properties is solved by introducing a
fixed background connection. In this way the generalized Dirac--Weyl operator
can be globally defined on $S^{2}$. The generating functional of the Green

existing in the finite-temperature (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow model is explored in
the regime when the Higgs field is not infinitely heavy, but its mass is rather
of the same order of magnitude as the mass of the W-boson. The corrections to
the standard RG flow are derived to the leading order in the inverse mass of
the Higgs boson. According to the obtained RG equations, the scaling of the
free-energy density in the critical region and the value of the critical
temperature of the phase transition are found to be unaffected by the
finiteness of the Higgs-boson mass. The evolution of the Higgs mass itself is
also investigated and shown to be rather weak, that enables one to treat this
parameter as a constant. The same analysis is further performed in the
SU(N)-case at N>2, where the RG invariance is demonstrated to hold only
approximately, in a certain sense. Modulo this approximation, the critical

string-like configuration in an extension of the standard model which
accommodates the most general fermionic mass matrix for neutrinos. If either
the left- or the right-handed Majorana mass vanishes, neutrino and electron
zero modes are found to exist. If the harmonic mean of the neutrino Majorana
masses is large compared to the Dirac mass, we can prove that normalizable
neutrino zero modes cease to exist. This leads to an odd number of fermionic
zero modes -- namely, only the electron zero mode -- which we argue implies
that the bosonic background is in a topologically distinct sector from the
vacuum. This is confirmed by noting that the bosonic sector of the model

which we use to calculate stringy (\alpha') corrections to standard model
dispersion relations, paying attention to the maximum speeds for different

dual to the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $SU(N+M)\times SU(N)$ gauge theory
coupled to bifundamental chiral superfields $A_i, B_j$, $i,j=1,2$. This
solution was found in hep-th/0007191, and its asymptotic form describing
logarithmic RG flow was constructed in hep-th/0002159. The leading tree-level
string correction to the type IIB string effective action is represented by the
invariant of the form $\a'{}^3 (R^4 + ...)$. Since the background contains
3-form field strengths, we need to know parts of this invariant that depend on
them. By analyzing the 5-point superstring scattering amplitudes we show that
only a few specific $R^3 (H_3)^2$ and $R^3 (F_3)^2$ terms are present in the
effective action.
  Their contribution to the holographic RG flow turns out to be of the same
order as of the $R^4$ terms. Using this fact we show that it is possible to
have agreement between the $\alpha'$-corrected radial dependence of the
supergravity fields and the RG flow dictated by the NSVZ beta functions in
field theory. The agreement with field theory requires that the anomalous
dimension of the operators $\Tr (A_i B_j)$ is corrected by a term of order

M-theory on $S^1/Z_2$, related to the supersymmetric $E_8\times E_8$ theory by
a chirality flip at one of the boundaries. This system represents an M-theory
analog of the D-brane anti-D-brane systems of string theory. Alternatively,
this compactification can be viewed as a model of supersymmetry breaking in the
``brane-world'' approach to phenomenology. We calculate the Casimir energy of
the system at large separations, and show that there is an attractive Casimir
force between the $E_8$ and $\bar E_8$ boundary. We predict that a tachyonic
instability develops at separations of order the Planck scale, and discuss the
possibility that the M-theory fivebrane might appear as a topological defect
supported by the $E_8\times\bar E_8$ system. Finally, we analyze the eventual
fate of the configuration, in the semiclassical approximation at large
separations: the two ends of the world annihilate by nucleating wormholes
between the two boundaries."

singularities and that is charged under an antisymmetric tensor field, the
background spacetime being maximally symmetric in n-dimensions with constant
curvature k=0,+1,-1. For k=1 the bulk solutions correspond to black q-branes.
For k=0,-1 the geometry resembles the `white hole' region of the
Reissner-N""ordstrom solution with a past Cauchy horizon. The metric between the
(timelike) singularity and the horizon is static whereas beyond the horizon it
is cosmological. In the particular case of q=0, we study the motion of a
codimension one n-brane in these charged dilatonic backgrounds that interpolate
between the original scalar self-tuning and the black hole geometry and provide
a way to avoid the naked singularity problem and/or the need of having exotic
matter on the brane. These backgrounds are asymmetrically warped and so break
4D Lorentz symmetry in a way that is safe for particle physics but may lead to
faster than light propagation in the gravitational sector."

realization of the Quantum Hall fluid. Since then it has been realized that the
Quantum Hall system is very closely related to non--commutative Chern Simons
theory and this suggests alternative brane constructions which we believe are
more reliable and clear. In this paper a brane construction is given for the
non--commutative Chern Simons Matrix formulation of the Quantum Hall system as
described by in recent papers by Susskind, Polychronakos and by Hellerman and
Van Raamsdonk. The system is a generalized version of Berkooz's ``Rigid Light
Cone Membrane which occurs as an excition of the DLCQ description of the
M5--brane in a background 3--form field. The original construction of Berkooz
corresponds to the fully filled $\nu =1$ state of the QH system. To change the
filling fraction to $\nu = 1/(k+1)$ a system of $k$ background D8-branes is
required. Quasi--hole excitations can be generated by passing a D6-brane though
the Rigid Membrane."

larger than the Planck or string scales, the dynamics of these extra dimensions
should be governed by classical general relativity. We argue that in general
relativity, it is highly nontrivial to obtain solutions where the extra
dimensions are static and are dynamically stable to small perturbations. We
also illustrate that intuition on equilibrium and stability built up from
non-gravitational physics can be highly misleading. For all static, homogeneous
solutions satisfying the null energy condition, we show that the Ricci
curvature of space must be nonnegative in all directions. Much of our analysis
focuses on a class of spacetime models where space consists of a product of
homogeneous and isotropic geometries. A dimensional reduction of these models
is performed, and their stability to perturbations that preserve the spatial
symmetries is analyzed. We conclude that the only physically realistic examples
of classically stabilized large extra dimensions are those in which the
extra-dimensional manifold is positively curved."

string field theory in the language of noncommutative field theory. In
particular, following the methods of hep-th/0202087, we find that in Siegel
gauge Witten's star product roughly corresponds to a continuous tensor product
of Clifford Algebras, and we formulate important operators of the theory in
this language, notably the kinetic operator of vacuum string field theory and
the BRST operator describing the vacuum of the unstable D-25 brane. We find
that the BRST operator is singular in this formulation. We explore alternative
operator/Moyal representations of the star product analogous to the split
string description and the discrete Moyal basis developed extensively in recent
work by Bars and Matsuo (hep-th/0204260). Finally we discuss some interesting
singulariries in the formalism and how they may be regulated."

gravity, we study the propagation of electrons in the background of
disclinations and screw dislocations. We study the situations where there are
bound states that are effectively localized on the defect and hence can be
described in terms of an effective 1+1 dimensional field theory for the low
energy excitations. In the case of screw dislocations, we find that these
excitations are chiral and can be described by an effective field theory of
chiral fermions. Fermions of both chirality occur even for a given direction of
the magnetic field. The ``net'' chirality of the system however is not always
the same for a given direction of the magnetic field, but changes from one sign
of the chirality through zero to the other sign as the Fermi momentum or the
magnitude of the magnetic flux is varied. On coupling to an external
electromagnetic field, the latter becomes anomalous, and predicts novel
conduction properties for these materials."

background with the circle compactification along a transverse direction. We
calculate it in the two ways: the operator formalism and the path-integral
calculation. The former gives the finite result with no subtlety of the Wick
rotation, which only contains the contributions of physical states. On the
other hand, the latter yields the manifestly modular invariant expression, even
though we only have the winding modes along the transverse circle (no
Kaluza-Klein excitations). We also check the equivalence of these two analyses.
The DLCQ approach makes the path-integration quite easy. Remarkably, we find
that the contributions from the transverse winding sectors disappear in the
non-DLCQ limit, while they indeed contribute in the DLCQ model, depending
non-trivially on the longitudinal quantum numbers."

in four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories with N >= 3, and in the large-N limit.
  Using the Wilson lattice formulation for numerical simulations, we compute
the first few terms of the expansion of the ground-state energy F(theta) around
theta = 0, F(theta) - F(0) = A_2 theta^2 (1 + b_2 theta^2 + ...). Our results
support Witten's conjecture: F(theta) - F(0) = A theta^2 + O(1/N) for theta <
pi.
  We verify that the topological susceptibility has a nonzero large-N limit
chi_infinity = 2A with corrections of O(1/N^2), in substantial agreement with
the Witten-Veneziano formula which relates chi_infinity to the eta' mass.
Furthermore, higher order terms in theta are suppressed; in particular, the
O(theta^4) term b_2 (related to the eta' - eta' elastic scattering amplitude)
turns out to be quite small: b_2 = -0.023(7) for N=3, and its absolute value
decreases with increasing N, consistently with the expectation b_2 = O(1/N^2)."

model with radius stabilization. Following the idea by Goldberger and Wise for
the radius stabilization, we introduce a scalar field which has potentials
localized on the branes in addition to a bulk potential. In our previous paper
we discussed gravitational perturbations induced by static, spherically
symmetric and nonrelativistic matter distribution on the branes under the
condition that the values of the scalar field on the respective branes cannot
fluctuate due to its extremely narrow brane potentials. We call this case the
strong coupling limit. Our concern in this paper is to generalize our previous
analysis relaxing the limitation of taking the strong coupling limit. We find
that new corrections in metric perturbations due to relaxing the strong
coupling limit enhance the deviation from the 4D Einstein gravity only in some
exceptional cases. In the case that matter fields reside on the negative
tension brane, the stabilized radion mass becomes very small when the new
correction becomes large."

thermodynamics along with the correspondence between near-horizon brane
solutions and field theories with 16 supercharges to describe the thermodynamic
behavior of these theories in the presence of voltages under the R-symmetry.
The thermodynamics is used to provide two pieces of evidence in favor of a
smooth interpolation function between the free energy at weak and strong
coupling of the field theory. (i) A computation of the boundaries of stability
shows that for the D2, D3, D4, M2 and M5-branes the critical values of Omega/T
in the two limits are remarkably close and (ii) The tree-level R^4 corrections
to the spinning D3-brane generate a decrease in the free energy at strong
coupling towards the weak coupling result. We also comment on the

group, we construct a non relativistic particle model in the plane. Owing to
the extra structure, the coordinates do not commute. Our model can be viewed as
the non-relativistic counterpart of the relativistic anyon considered before by
Jackiw and Nair. For a particle moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to the
plane, the two parameters combine with the magnetic field to provide an
effective mass. For vanishing effective mass the phase space admits a
two-dimensional reduction, which represents the condensation to collective
``Hall'' motions and justifies the rule called ``Peierls substitution''.
Quantization yields the wave functions proposed by Laughlin to describe the
Fractional Quantum Hall Effect."

constructed in the fully interacting four dimensional N=4 Super-Yang-Mills
theory with gauge group SU(N). These operators are annihilated by four
supercharges, and at order g^2 have protected scaling dimension and
normalization. Here, we compute three-point functions involving these
quarter-BPS operators along with half-BPS operators. The combinatorics of the
problem is rather involved, and we consider the following special cases: (1)
correlators < half half BPS > of two half-BPS primaries with an arbitrary
chiral primary; (2) certain classes of < half quarter quarter > and < quarter
quarter quarter > three-point functions; (3) three-point functions involving
the Delta < 8 operators found in hep-th/0109064; (4) < half quarter quarter>
correlators with the special quarter-BPS operator made of single and double
trace operators only. The analysis in cases (1)-(3) is valid for general N,
while (4) is a large N approximation. Order g^2 corrections to all three-point
functions considered in this paper are found to vanish.
  In the AdS/CFT correspondence, quarter-BPS chiral primaries are dual to
threshold bound states of elementary supergravity excitations. We present a

limits of M2, M5, and D3-branes with a particular pp-wave propagating in a
world volume direction. We show that the uncompactified near horizon
configurations K\times S are solutions of D=11 or D=10 IIB supergravity which
correspond to perturbed versions of their AdS \times S analogues. We derive the
Penrose-Gueven limits of the Kaigorodov space and the total spaces and analyse
their symmetries. An Inonu-Wigner contraction of the Lie algebra is shown to
occur, although there is a symmetry enhancement. We compare the results to the
maximally supersymmetric CW spaces found as limits of AdS\times S spacetimes:
the initial gravitational perturbation on the brane and its near horizon
geometry remains after taking non-trivial Penrose limits, but seems to
decouple. One particuliar limit yields a time-dependent homogeneous plane-wave
background whose string theory is solvable, while in the other cases we find
inhomogeneous backgrounds."

propose a general relationship between Rozansky-Witten (RW) and 3-dimensional
Abelian monopole invariants. In particular, we deduce the equality of the SU(2)
Casson invariant and the 3-dimensional SW invariant (this includes a special
case of the Meng-Taubes theorem relating the SW invariant to Milnor torsion).
Since there are only a finite number of basic RW invariants of a given degree,
many different topological field theories can be used to represent essentially
the same topological invariant. This leads us to advocate using higher rank
Abelian gauge theories to shed light on the higher (non-Abelian) RW invariants
and we write down candidate higher rank SW equations."

or D-branes forces the space-time coordinates to be noncommutative. This effect
is equivalent to replacing ordinary products in the effective theory by the
deformed star product. An immediate consequence of this is that all fields get
complexified. The only possible noncommutative Yang-Mills theory is the one
with U(N) gauge symmetry. By applying this idea to gravity one discovers that
the metric becomes complex. We show in this article that this procedure is
completely consistent and one can obtain complexified gravity by gauging the
symmetry $U(1,D-1)$ instead of the usual $SO(1,D-1)$. The final theory depends
on a Hermitian tensor containing both the symmetric metric and antisymmetric
tensor. In contrast to other theories of nonsymmetric gravity the action is
both unique and gauge invariant. The results are then generalized to
noncommutative spaces."

related to unitarity bounds in the boundary CFT. We show that no charged or

extended supergravities with de Sitter (dS) solutions. Some of them are related
to M-theory with non-compact internal spaces. Masses of ultra-light scalars in
these models are quantized in units of the Hubble constant: m^2 = n H^2. If dS
solution corresponds to a minimum of the effective potential, the universe
eventually becomes dS space. If dS solution corresponds to a maximum or a
saddle point, which is the case in all known models based on N=8 supergravity,
the flat universe eventually stops accelerating and collapses to a singularity.
We show that in these models, as well as in the simplest models of dark energy
based on N=1 supergravity, the typical time remaining before the global
collapse is comparable to the present age of the universe, t = O(10^{10})
years. We discuss the possibility of distinguishing between various models and
finding our destiny using cosmological observations."

varies over the extra dimensions due to different warp factors for the space
and the time coordinates (``asymmetrically warped'' spacetimes). The main
property of such spaces is that while the induced metric is flat, implying
Lorentz invariant particle physics on a brane, bulk gravitational effects will
cause apparent violations of Lorentz invariance and of causality from the brane
observer's point of view. An important experimentally verifiable consequence of
this is that gravitational waves may travel with a speed different from the
speed of light on the brane, and possibly even faster. We find the most general
spacetimes of this sort, which are given by certain types of black hole
spacetimes characterized by the mass and the charge of the black hole. We show
how to satisfy the junction conditions and analyze the properties of these
space-times."

examined. Due to the non-compact extra dimension, the perturbation spectrum has
no mass gap, and the long wavelength effective theory is only understood
perturbatively. The full 5-dimensional Einstein equations are solved
numerically for static, spherically symmetric matter localized on the brane,
yielding regular geometries in the bulk with axial symmetry. An elliptic
relaxation method is used, allowing both the brane and asymptotic radiation
boundary conditions to be simultaneously imposed. The same data that specifies
stars in 4-dimensional gravity, uniquely constructs a 5-dimensional solution.
The algorithm performs best for small stars (radius less than the AdS length)
yielding highly non-linear solutions. An upper mass limit is observed for these
small stars, and the geometry shows no global pathologies. The geometric
perturbation is shown to remain localized near the brane at high densities, the
confinement interestingly increasing for both small and large stars as the
upper mass limit is approached. Furthermore, the static spatial sections are
found to be approximately conformal to those of AdS. We show that the intrinsic
geometry of large stars, with radius several times the AdS length, is described
by 4-dimensional General Relativity far past the perturbative regime. This
indicates that the non-linear long wavelength effective action remains local,
even though the perturbation spectrum has no mass gap. The implication is that
Randall-Sundrum gravity, with localized brane matter, reproduces relativistic
astrophysical solutions, such as neutron stars and massive black holes,
consistent with observation."

open string degrees of freedom. We also show that, at a sufficiently large
temperature, the open string vacuum becomes stable. Building upon this
observation and previous work by Horowitz, Maldacena and Strominger, we
formulate a microscopic brane-antibrane model for the non-extremal black
three-brane in ten dimensions (as well as for the black two- and five-branes in
eleven dimensions). Under reasonable assumptions, and using known results from
the AdS/CFT correspondence, the microscopic entropy agrees with the
supergravity result up to a factor of 2^(p/p+1), with p the dimension of the
brane. The negative specific heat and pressure of the black brane have a simple
interpretation in terms of brane-antibrane annihilation. We also find in the
model states resembling black holes and other lower-dimensional black branes."

(3+1)-dimensional Minkowskian spacetime is presented. This construction is
provided by a classical r-matrix spanned by ten Weyl-Poincare generators, which
generalizes non-standard quantum deformations previously obtained for so(2,2)
and so(3,2). However, by introducing a conformal null-plane basis it is found
that the twist can indeed be supported by an eight-dimensional carrier
subalgebra. By construction the Weyl-Poincare subalgebra remains as a Hopf
subalgebra after deformation. Non-relativistic limits of U_z(so(4,2)) are shown
to be well defined and they give rise to new twisted conformal algebras of
Galilean and Carroll spacetimes. Furthermore a difference-differential massless
Klein-Gordon (or wave) equation with twisted conformal symmetry is constructed
through deformed momenta and position operators. The deformation parameter is
interpreted as the lattice step on a uniform Minkowskian spacetime lattice
discretized along two basic null-plane directions."

""no scale"" mechanism for supersymmetry breaking with no unstable moduli.
Supersymmetry is broken by a constant superpotential localized on a brane, and
the radion is stabilized by Casimir energy from supergravity and massive
hypermultiplets. If the standard model gauge and matter fields are localized on
a brane, then visible sector supersymmetry breaking is dominated by gravity
loops and flavor-violating hypermultiplet loops, and gaugino masses are smaller
than scalar masses. We present a realistic model in which the the standard
model gauge fields are partly localized. In this model visible sector
supersymmetry breaking is naturally gaugino mediated, while masses of the
gravitino and gravitational moduli are larger than the weak scale."

Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model as an (n-1)(n+2)-dimensional manifold M_q
equipped with a symplectic form involving a special 2-form - the Wess-Zumino
(WZ) term - which depends on the monodromy M. This classical system exhibits a
Poisson-Lie symmetry that evolves upon quantization into an U_q(sl_n) symmetry
for q a primitive even root of 1. For each constant solution of the classical
Yang-Baxter equation we write down explicitly a corresponding WZ term and
invert the symplectic form thus computing the Poisson bivector of the system.
The resulting Poisson brackets appear as the classical counterpart of the
exchange relations of the quantum matrix algebra studied previously. We argue
that it is advantageous to equate the determinant D of the zero modes' matrix
to a pseudoinvariant under permutations q-polynomial in the SU(n) weights,
rather than to adopt the familiar convention D=1."

a certain limit of the space AdS^5xS^5. According to the AdS/CFT
correspondence, the holographic dual of superstring theory on that background
should be the analogous limit of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In this
paper we shall show that, contrary to widespread expectation, non-planar
diagrams survive this limiting procedure in the gauge theory. Using matrix
model techniques as well as combinatorial reasoning it is demonstrated that a
subset of diagrams of arbitrary genus survives and that a non-trivial double
scaling limit may be defined. We exactly compute two- and three-point functions
of chiral primaries in this limit. We also carefully study certain operators
conjectured to correspond to string excitations on the pp-wave background. We
find non-planar linear mixing of these proposed operators, requiring their
redefinition. Finally, we show that the redefined operators receive non-planar
corrections to the planar one-loop anomalous dimension."

quantum gravity, with and without matter, by quantum field theoretical methods.
More specifically, we work within a covariant lattice approach where the
individual space-time geometries are constructed from fundamental simplicial
building blocks, and the path integral over geometries is approximated by
summing over a class of piece-wise linear geometries. This method of
``dynamical triangulations'' is very powerful in 2d, where the regularized
theory can be solved explicitly, and gives us more insights into the quantum
nature of 2d space-time than continuum methods are presently able to provide.
It also allows us to establish an explicit relation between the Lorentzian- and
Euclidean-signature quantum theories. Analogous regularized gravitational
models can be set up in higher dimensions. Some analytic tools exist to study
their state sums, but, unlike in 2d, no complete analytic solutions have yet
been constructed. However, a great advantage of our approach is the fact that
it is well-suited for numerical simulations. In the second part of this review
we describe the relevant Monte Carlo techniques, as well as some of the
physical results that have been obtained from the simulations of Euclidean
gravity. We also explain why the Lorentzian version of dynamical triangulations
is a promising candidate for a non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity."

algebras for d=1+1 factorizing theories are determined. The well-known on-shell
crossing symmetry of the S-Matrix and of formfactors (cyclicity relation) in
such theories is intimately related to the KMS properties of new quantum-local
PFG (one-particle polarization-free generators) of these wedge algebras. These
generators are ``on-shell'' and their Fourier transforms turn out to fulfill
the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. As the wedge algebras contain the crossing
symmetry informations, the double cone algebras reveal the particle content of
fields. Modular theory associates with this double cone algebra two very useful
chiral conformal quantum field theories which are the algebraic versions of the
light ray algebras."

intersections. We study the construction of four-dimensional chiral gauge
theories by considering configurations of type II D(3+n)-branes wrapped on
non-trivial n-cycles on T^{2n} x(R^{2(3-n)}/Z_N), for n=1,2,3. The gauge
theories on the four non-compact dimensions of the brane world-volume are
generically chiral and non-supersymmetric. We analyze consistency conditions
(RR tadpole cancellation) for these models, and their relation to
four-dimensional anomaly cancellation. Cancellation of U(1) gauge anomalies
involves a Green-Schwarz mechanism mediated by RR partners of untwisted and/or
twisted moduli. This class of models is of potential phenomenological interest,
and we construct explicit examples of SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) three-generation
models. The models are non-supersymmetric, but the string scale may be lowered
close to the weak scale so that the standard hierarchy problem is avoided. We
also comment on the presence of scalar tachyons and possible ways to avoid the
associated instabilities. We discuss the existence of (meta)stable
configurations of D-branes on 3-cycles in (T^2)^3, free of tachyons for certain
ranges of the six-torus moduli."

the coupling to the gauge fields is not chirally symmetric and which
nevertheless do not suffer from gauge anomalies. To be specific we study two
dimensional Abelian models in the Hamiltonian framework which can be
constructed and solved by standard techniques. The general model describes
$\Np$ photon fields and $\Nf$ flavors of Dirac fermions with $2\Nf\Np$
different coupling constants i.e. the chiral component of each fermion can be

which involves bound states that are non self-conjugate solutions of the Bethe
equations. Our method provides equivalently the solution of the su(3)
generalization of the XXZ chain. In the repulsive regime, we confirm that the
scattering theory proposed over the past few years - made only of solitons with
non diagonal S-matrices - is complete. But we show that unitarity does not
follow, contrary to early claims, eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix not being
pure phases. In the attractive regime, we find that the proposed minimal
solution of the bootstrap equations is actually far from being complete. We
discuss some simple values of the couplings, where, instead of the few

  We point out that the form of the function is determined by a parameter

  For a particular value of the parameter, the warped metric function is smooth
without having a singularity, and we show that the bulk cosmological constant
have a upper bound and must be positive and that the lower bound of
five-dimensional fundamental scale is controlled by both the brane tension and
four-dimensional effective Planck scale.

sufficiently large ultra-violet cutoff, NPRG results coincide with those of

improve the approximation, we incorporate the mesonic fluctuations. We
introduce the auxiliary fields for mesons, and then derive NPRG equation for

superpotential, we investigate the relevant mass perturbations of the
Leigh-Strassler marginal ``q'' deformation of N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory.
We recall a conjecture for the elliptic superpotential that describes the
theory compactified on a circle and identify this superpotential as one of the
Hamiltonians of the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider integrable system. In the
limit that the Leigh-Strassler deformation is turned off, the integrable system
reduces to the elliptic Calogero-Moser system which describes the N=1^* theory.
Based on these results, we identify the Coulomb branch of the partially
mass-deformed Leigh-Strassler theory as the spectral curve of the
Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. We also show how the Leigh-Strassler deformation
may be obtained by suitably modifying Witten's M theory brane construction of
N=2 theories."

four dimensions describing black holes which asymptote to the linear dilaton
background. In the non-rotating case they can be obtained as the limiting
geometry of dilaton black holes. The rotating solutions (possibly endowed with
a NUT parameter) are constructed using a generating technique based on the
Sp(4,R) duality of the EMDA system. In a certain limit (with no event horizon
present) our rotating solutions coincide with supersymmetric
Israel-Wilson-Perjes type dilaton-axion solutions. In presence of an event
horizon supersymmetry is broken. The temperature of the static black holes is
constant, and their mass does not depend on it, so the heat capacity is zero.
We investigate geodesics and wave propagation in these spacetimes and find
superradiance in the rotating case. Because of the non-asymptotically flat
nature of the geometry, certain modes are reflected from infinity, in
particular, all superradiant modes are confined. This leads to classical
instability of the rotating solutions. The non-rotating linear dilaton black
holes are shown to be stable under spherical perturbations."

only in even dimensional spacetimes and that self-duality is further restricted
to twice-odd dimensional spacetime theories.
  The purpose of this paper is to extend the notion of both duality symmetry as
well as self-duality.
  By considering tensorial doublets, we introduce a novel well-defined notion
of self-duality based on a duality Hodge-type operation in arbitrary dimension
and for any rank of these tensors. Thus, a generalized Self-Dual Action is
defined such that equations of motion are the claimed generalized self-duality
relations. We observe in addition, that taking the proper limit on the
parameters of this action, it always provides us with a master-action, which
interpolates models well-studied in physics; by considering a particular limit,
we find an action which describes an interesting type of relation, referred to
as semi-self-duality, which results to be the parent action between Maxwell-
type actions.

reviewing some known results concerning brane dynamics on group manifolds.
These are then employed to study condensation in cosets of the WZW model. While
the basic ideas are more general, our presentation focuses on parafermion
theories and, closely related, N=2 superconformal minimal models. We determine
the (non-commutative) low energy effective actions for all maximally symmetric
branes in a decoupling limit of the two theories. These actions are used to
show that the lightest branes can be regarded as elementary constituents for
all other maximally symmetric branes."

AdS_3) can be replaced by a three-dimensional lens space (or a BTZ black hole),
which arises naturally from the introduction of a NUT (or a pp-wave) to the
M-branes or the D3-brane. We then obtain multi-intersections by performing a
Kaluza-Klein reduction or Hopf T-duality transformation on the fibre coordinate
of the lens space (or the BTZ black hole). These geometries provide further
possible examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of consistent embeddings of
lower-dimensional gauged supergravities in D=11 or D=10."

$\delta,g\geq0$ is non-Hermitian, but the energy levels are real and positive
as a consequence of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. The quantum mechanical theory
described by $H$ is treated as a one-dimensional Euclidean quantum field
theory. The two-point Green's function for this theory is investigated using
perturbative and numerical techniques. The K\""allen-Lehmann representation for
the Green's function is constructed, and it is shown that by virtue of ${\cal

at critical $\theta m^2$. The stability or non-stability of the system may then
be determined entirely by the $\phi^3$ coefficient in the potential. For
higher-level solutions we find an ambiguity in extrapolating solutions to
finite $\theta$ which prevents us from making any general statements. For these
stability may be determined by comparing the fluctuation eigenvalues to

dimension is bounded and the remaining (parallel) dimensions are not. We study
the construction of effective theories at distances much longer than the
transverse size. An observer unable to resolve the transverse direction can
only measure distances along the parallel dimensions, but the non-factorizable
geometry makes the length of a curve along the parallel dimension sensitive to
where on the transverse direction the curve lies. We show that long geodesics
that differ in their endpoints only by shifts along the transverse direction
all have the same length to within the observer's resolution. We argue that
this is the correct notion of distance in the effective theory for a bulk
observer. This allows us to present a consistent interpretation of what is
measured by observers that live either on a brane or in the bulk."

theories of Bogomol'nyi type is the geodesic approximation of Manton. In the
case of vortices and monopoles, Stuart has obtained rigorous estimates of the
errors in this approximation, and hence proved that it is valid in the low
speed regime. His method employs energy estimates which rely on a key
coercivity property of the Hessian of the energy functional of the theory under
consideration. In this paper we prove an analogous coercivity property for the
Hessian of the energy functional of a general sigma model with compact K\""ahler
domain and target. We go on to prove a continuity property for our result, and
show that, for the CP^1 model on S^2, the Hessian fails to be globally coercive
in the degree 1 sector. We present numerical evidence which suggests that the
Hessian is globally coercive in a certain equivariance class of the degree n
sector for n>1. We also prove that, within the geodesic approximation, a single
CP^1 lump moving on S^2 does not generically travel on a great circle."

Here we show that a different type of deformation exists in three dimensions if
one allows for PT non-invariant terms. The new gauge algebra is different from
that of diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, this deformation can be generalized to
the case of a collection of massless spin-two fields. In this case it describes
a consistent interaction among them."

showing that a certain family of gauge conditions leads to an A-infty algebra

of physical states. Upon using results of modern deformation theory, I show
that the string moduli space admits two equivalent descriptions, one given in
standard Maurer-Cartan fashion and another given in terms of a `homotopy
Maurer-Cartan problem', which describes the critical set of the potential. By
applying this construction to the topological A and B models, I obtain an
intrinsic formulation of `D-brane superpotentials' in terms of string field
theory data. This gives a prescription for computing such quantities to all
orders, and proves the equivalence of this formulation with the fundamental
description in terms of string field moduli. In particular, it clarifies the

(i.e. states with maximal supersymmetry) in different dimensions the particle
content is calculated, i.e. the spectrum of usual Poincar{\'e} representations
in the preon representation of tensorial Poincar{\'e}. At d=4 results coincide
with (and may provide another point of view on) the Vasiliev's results in field
theories in generalized space-time. The translational subgroup of little groups
of massless particles and branes is shown to be (and coincide with, at d=4) a
subgroup of little groups of ""pure branes"" algebras, i.e. tensorial
Poincar{\'e} algebras without vector generators. At 11d it is shown that,
contrary to lower dimensions, spinors are not homogeneous space of Lorentz

invariant interacting equations for a bosonic string using the loop variable
approach. In the earlier paper the equations were written down in one higher
dimension where the fields are massless. In this paper we describe a procedure
for dimensional reduction that gives interacting equations for fields with the
same spectrum as in bosonic string theory. We also argue that the on-shell
scattering amplitudes implied by these equations for the physical modes are the
same as for the bosonic string. We check this explicitly for some of the
simpler equations. The gauge transformation of space-time fields induced by
gauge transformations of the loop variables are discussed in some detail. The
unintegrated (i.e. before the Koba-Nielsen integration), regularized version of
the equations, are gauge invariant off-shell (i.e. off the {\em free} mass
shell)."

NS5-brane is considered as elementary in that the associated current is a
delta-function supported on its worldvolume. Our approach is based on a
Chern-kernel which encodes the singularities of the three-form field strength
near the brane in an SO(4)-invariant way and provides a solution for its
Bianchi identity in terms of a two-form potential. A dimensional reduction of
the recently constructed anomaly-free effective action for an elementary

noncommutative geometry. The new principle implies that the Dirac operator is
covariant with respect to Lorentz and internal gauge transformations and the
Dirac operator must include Yukawa couplings. It further implies that the
action for the metric, the gauge potentials and the Higgs scalar is coded in
the spectrum of the covariant Dirac operator. This ``universal'' action has
been computed by Chamseddine & Connes, it is the coupled Einstein-Hilbert and

quantized through the construction of the generating functional for Green

assumptions concerning their properties are introduced. A physical line in the
form of a circle is called a \emph{$J$-string}. It is assumed that a $J$-string
has an angular momentum whose value is $\hbar$. It is then established that a
$J$-string of radius $R$ possesses a mass $m_J$, equal to $h/2\pi c R$, a
corresponding energy, as well as a charge $q_J$, where $q_J = (hc/2\pi)^{1/2}$.
It is shown that this physical curve consists of indivisible line segments of
length $\ell_\Delta = 2\pi(hG/c^3)^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and
$G$ is the gravitational constant. Quantum features of $J$-strings are studied.
Based upon investigation of the properties and characteristics of $J$-strings,
a method is developed for the computation of the Planck length and mass
$(\ell^*_P, m^*_P)$. The values of $\ell^*_P$ and $m^*_P$ are computed
according to the resulting formulae (and given in the paper); these values
differ from the currently accepted ones."

resonances for $Z$-boson and hadrons, we suggest a definition of unstable
particles by ``minimally complex'' semigroup representations of the Poincar\'e
group characterized by $(j,{\mathsf s}=(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2})$ in which the Lorentz
subgroup is unitary. This definition, though decidedly distinct from those
based on various renormalization schemes of perturbation theory, is intimately
connected with the first order pole definition of the $S$-matrix theory in that
the complex square mass $(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2}$ characterizing the representation
of the Poincar\'e semigroup is exactly the position ${\mathsf s}_R$ at which
the $S$-matrix has a simple pole. Wigner's representations $(j,m)$ are the
limit case of the complex representations for $\Gamma=0$. These representations
have generalized vectors (Gamow kets) which have, in addition to the $S$-matrix
pole at ${\mathsf s}=(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2}$, all the other properties that
heuristically the unstable states need to possess: a Breit-Wigner distribution
in invariant square mass and a lifetime $\tau=\frac{1}{\Gamma}$ defined by the
exactly exponential law for the decay probability ${\cal P}(t)$ and rate
$\dot{\cal P}(t)$ given by an exact Golden Rule which becomes Dirac's Golden

and one, which we here call ""DSR2"", proposed by Magueijo and Smolin in
hep-th/0112090. We argue that a key aspect of such theories are the kinematical
conditions for particle production in collision processes. We derive these
kinematical conditions for DSR2, which was originally formulated only in the
one-particle sector. This result is then used to characterize the differences
between the two proposals; in particular, we find that, while experiments such
as AMS and GLAST can test some of the predictions of DSR1, the effects
predicted by DSR2 are much weaker and none of them should be testable in the
foreseeable future. We also show that if one interprets, as done in
hep-th/0112090, the DSR2-boost parameter $v$ as the relative velocity between
the observers connected by the boost one is then forced to give up the
""Hamiltonian"" relation $v_{particle} =dE/dp$ between the speed of a particle
and its momentum. We argue that, adopting an accordingly modified
interpretation of the DSR2-boost parameter $v$, one can maintain the relation
$v_{particle} =dE/dp$ in DSR2."

six dimensions using minimal gauged supergravity. By perturbing the theory with
the addition of a relevant operator of dimension four one flows to a
non-supersymmetric conformal fixed point. There are also solutions describing
non-conformal vacua of the same theory obtained by giving an expectation value
to the operator. One such vacuum is supersymmetric and is obtained by using the
true superpotential of the theory. We discuss the physical acceptability of
these vacua by applying the criteria recently given by Gubser for the four
dimensional case and find that those criteria give a clear physical picture in
the six dimensional case as well. We use this example to comment on the role of
the Hamilton-Jacobi equations in implementing the RG. We conclude with some

also show that Haldane states at any generic hierarhical level n may be
realised in terms of n Laughlin states composites and rederive results for the
n=2,3 levels respectively associated with $\nu= {{2}\over{5}}$ and $\nu=

-p_1 -p_2}}$, with $p_1$ odd and $p_2$ and $p_3$ even integers, and show that,
upon imposing the Gl(n,Z) invariance, we get remarkable informations on their
stability. Then, we reconsider the Rausch de Traubenberg and Slupinsky (RdTS)
algebra recently obtained in [1,2] and analyse its limit on the boundary
$\partial({AdS_3})$ of the (1+2) dimensional manifold $AdS_3$. We show that
generally one may distinguish bulk highest weight states (BHWS) living in

$\partial({AdS_3})$. We explore these two kinds of RdTS representations

existing knowledge for a family of deformations of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills theory
involving an arbitrary polynomial superpotential for one of the three adjoint
chiral superfields. Specifically, we compare the DV prediction for these models
with earlier results based on the connection between SUSY gauge theories and
integrable systems. We find complete agreement between the two approaches. In
particular we show how the DV proposal allows the extraction of the exact
eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar in the confining vacuum and hence computes
all related condensates of the finite-N gauge theory. We extend these results
to include Leigh-Strassler deformations of the N=4 theory."

and generic bare hypermultiplet (quark) masses. In SU(n_c) theories with n_f
\leq n_c the vacua are labelled by an integer r, in which the flavor U(n_f)
symmetry is dynamically broken to U(r) \times U(n_f-r) in the limit of
vanishing bare hyperquark masses. In the r=1 vacua the dynamical symmetry
breaking is caused by the condensation of magnetic monopoles in the n_f
representation. For general r, however, the monopoles in the {}_{n_f}C_r
representation, whose condensation could explain the flavor symmetry breaking
but would produce too-many Nambu--Goldstone multiplets, actually ""break up""
into ""magnetic quarks"": the latter with nonabelian interactions condense and
induce confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking. In USp(2n_c) theories with
n_f \leq n_c + 1, the flavor SO(2n_f) symmetry is dynamically broken to U(n_f),
but with no description in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory. In
both SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) theories, with larger numbers of quark flavors,
besides the vacua with these properties, there exist also vacua in free
magnetic phase, with unbroken global symmetry."

Working with a derivative expansion for the background fields, but exact in
their constant parts, we obtain a tachyonic on-shell condition for the inserted
functions and extract the kinetic term for the tachyon action. The 3-point
correlator yields a non-commutative tachyon potential. We also find a
remarkable feature of the differential structure on the D-brane: Although the
boundary metric $G$ plays an essential role in the action, the natural
connection on the D-brane is the same as in closed string theory, i.e. it is
compatible with the bulk metric and has torsion $H=dB$. This means, in
particular, that the parallel transport on the brane is independent of the
gauge field $A$."

construct the first examples of three generation string GUT models (PS-A
class), that contain at low energy exactly the standard model spectrum with no
extra matter and/or extra gauge group factors. They are based on the group
$SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. The models are non-supersymmetric,
even though SUSY is unbroken in the bulk. Baryon number is gauged and its
anomalies are cancelled through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism. We also
discuss models (PS-B class) which at low energy have the standard model
augmented by an anomaly free U(1) symmetry and show that multibrane wrappings
correspond to a trivial redefinition of the surviving global U(1) at low
energies. There are no colour triplet couplings to mediate proton decay and
proton is stable. The models are compatible with a low string scale of energy
less that 650 GeV and are directly testable at present or future accelerators
as they predict the existence of light left handed weak fermion doublets at
energies between 90 and 246 GeV. The neutrinos get a mass through an
unconventional see-saw mechanism. The mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUT
scale is recovered. Imposing supersymmetry at particular intersections
generates non-zero Majorana masses for right handed neutrinos as well providing
the necessary singlets needed to break the surviving anomaly free U(1), thus
suggesting a gauge symmetry breaking method that can be applied in general
left-right symmetric models."

of a scalar field T. We find that for models with runaway potentials V(T) the
generic inhomogeneous solutions after a short transient stage can be very well
approximated by the solutions of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation that describes free
streaming wave front propagation. The analytic solution for this wave
propagation shows the formation of caustics with multi-valued regions beyond
them. We verified that these caustics appear in numerical solutions of the
original scalar BI non-linear equations. Our results include the scalar BI
model with an exponential potential, which was recently proposed as an
effective action for the string theory tachyon in the approximation where
high-order spacetime derivatives of T are truncated. Since the actual string
tachyon dynamics contain derivatives of all orders, the tachyon BI model with
an exponential potential becomes inadequate when the caustics develop because
high order spatial derivatives of T become divergent. BI type tachyon theory
with a potential decreasing at large T could have interesting cosmological
applications because the tachyon field rolling towards its ground state at
infinity acts as pressureless dark matter. We find that inhomogeneous
cosmological tachyon fluctuations rapidly grow and develop multiple caustics.
Any considerations of the role of the tachyon field in cosmology will have to
involve finding a way to predict the behavior of the field at and beyond these
caustics."

worldvolumes. If we demand that the curved brane solution admits Killing
spinors, then its worldvolume must admit parallel spinors. Classes of
Ricci-flat worldvolumes admitting parallel spinors are discussed."

spectrum of temperature anistropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background produced
during inflation. We present a general argument-assuming only low energy
locality-that the size of such effects are of order H^2/M^2, where H is the
Hubble parameter during inflation, and M is the scale of the high energy
physics.
  We evaluate the strength of such effects in a number of specific string and M
theory models. In weakly coupled field theory and string theory models, the
effects are far too small to be observed. In phenomenologically attractive
Horava-Witten compactifications, the effects are much larger but still
unobservable. In certain M theory models, for which the fundamental Planck
scale is several orders of magnitude below the conventional scale of grand
unification, the effects may be on the threshold of detectability.
  However, observations of both the scalar and tensor fluctuation contributions
to the Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum-with a precision near the
cosmic variance limit-are necessary in order to unambiguously demonstrate the
existence of these signatures of high energy physics. This is a formidable
experimental challenge."

admit, in the general case, only non-extreme black holes. It is shown that
there exist exceptional degenerate cases, that can be obtained by some limiting
transitions from the general exact solution, which include, in particular,
extremal and ultraextremal black holes. We also analyze properties of extreme
black holes without demanding exact solvability and show that for such
solutions quantum backreaction forbids the existence of ultraextreme black
holes. The conditions,under which divergencies of quantum stresses in a free
falling frame can disappear, are found. We derive the closed equation with
respect to the metric as a function of the dilaton field that enables one,
choosing the form of the metric, to restore corresponding Lagrangian. It is
demonstrated that exactly solvable models, found earlier, can be extended to
include an electric charge only in two cases: either the dilaton-gravitation
coupling is proportional to the potential term, or the latter vanishes. The
second case leads to the effective potential with a negative amplitude and we
analyze, how this fact affects the structure of spacetime. We also discuss the

the point of view of noncommutative gauge theories with extended SUSY

the commutator in the scalar potential. This provides one-loop
renormalizability of noncommutative N=2 SUSY gauge theory. We demonstrate a

$S^1/Z_2$ and $T^5/Z_2$ in the upstairs approach. The main requirement that
allows one to uniquely define solutions to the modified Bianchi identities in
this case is that the field strength $G$ be globally defined on $S^1$ or $T^5$
and properly transforming under $Z_2$. We solve for general $G$ that satisfies
these requirements and explicitly construct anomaly-free theories in the
upstairs approach. We also obtain the solutions in the presence of five-branes.
All these constructions show equivalence of the downstairs and upstairs
approaches. For example in the $S^1/Z_2$ case the ten-dimensional gauge
coupling and the anomaly cancellation at each wall are the same as in the
downstairs approach."

angular momentum directly from either the relation $\Delta t\Delta x^2>l_p^3$

compact U(1) gauge Maxwell Chern-Simons and the nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics Azbel-Hofstadter model of Bloch-electrons. The $U_q(sl_2)$ quantum
group and the magnetic translations group of the Azbel-Hofstadter model
correspond to discretized U(1) gauge transformations, they correspond to
subgroups with linear gauge parameter. The monopole confining and monopole
condensate phases in the TQFT are identified with the extended (energy bands)
and localized (gaps) phases of the bloch electron. The monopole condensate
induces at the nonrelativistic level gravitational white holes due to deformed
classical gauge fields, furthermore these gravitational solutions render the
existence of finite energy pure magnetic monopoles possible. This mechanism
constitutes a dynamical symmetry breaking of the theory which regularizes the
solutions on those localized phases allowing physical solutions of the
Shr\""odinger equation which are chains of electron strings connecting several
monopole-white holes. An experiment to test these results is suggested which
would test the existence of magnetic monopoles and classical gravity to a scale
of $\sim 10^{-17}$ \textit{meters}, the dimension of the monopole-white hole."

embedded in an Anti-de Sitter bulk. We use a novel gauge, in which the full
five-dimensional problem is in principle solvable. In this gauge we derive the
equations for scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. These equations are
necessary in order to calculate microwave background anisotropies in this
particular scenario. Throughout the paper, we draw attention to the influence
of the bulk gravitons, which act as a source for the perturbations on the
brane. In addition, we find that isocurvature modes are generated due to the
influence of bulk gravitons."

D3-branes sitting on top of an orientifold 3-plane. The transverse
6-dimensional space is a non-compact orbifold (or a more general conifold). The
4-dimensional gravity on D3-branes is reproduced due to the 4-dimensional
Einstein-Hilbert term induced at the quantum level. The orientifold 3-plane
plays a crucial role, in particular, without it the D3-brane world-volume
theories would be conformal due to the tadpole cancellation. We study
non-perturbative gauge dynamics in various N=1 supersymmetric orientiworld
models based on the Z_3 as well as Z_5 and Z_7 orbifold groups. Our discussions
illustrate that there is a rich variety of supersymmetry preserving dynamics in
some of these models. On the other hand, we also find some models with
dynamical supersymmetry breaking."

explicit gauge dependence are convenient. The well-known example is the gauge
parameter in the covariant gauge fixing which is of course most suitable for
the perturbation theory but a negative metric prevents us from imaging a
dynamical picture. Noncovariant gauge such as the Coulomb gauge is on the
contrary used for many physical situations. Therefore it is desirable to
include both cases. More than ten years ago, Steinmann introduced a function
(distribution) which can play this role in his attempt on discussing quantum
electrodynamics (QED) in terms of the gauge invariant fields solely. The method
is, however, broken down in the covariant case: the invariant operators are
ill-defined because of 1/p^2 singularity in the Minkowski space. In this paper,
we apply his function to the path integral: utilizing the arbitrariness of the
function we first restrict it to be able to have a well- defined operator, and
then a Hamiltonian with which we can build up the (Euclidean) path integral
formula. Although the formula is far from covariant, a full covariant
expression is recovered by reviving the components which have been discarded
under the construction of the Hamiltonian. There is no pathological defects
contrary to the operator formalism. With the aid of the path integral formula,
the gauge independence of the free energy as well as the S-matrix is proved.
Moreover the reason is clarified why it is so simple and straightforward to
argue gauge transformations in the path integral. Discussions on the quark
confinement is also presented."

qualitatively quite different, there are continuous families of configurations
that connect the two. In this paper we use self-gravitating monopole solutions
as tools for investigating the transition between these two types of
spacetimes. We show how causally distinct regions emerge as the black hole
limit is achieved, even though the measurements made by an external observer
vary continuously. We find that near-critical solutions have a naturally
defined entropy, despite the absence of a true horizon, and that this has a
clear connection with the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. We find that certain
classes of near-critical solutions display naked black hole behavior, although
they are not truly black holes at all. Finally, we present a numerical
simulation illustrating how an incident pulse of matter can induce the
dynamical collapse of a monopole into an extremal black hole. We discuss the
implications of this process for the third law of black hole thermodynamics."

four-dimensional graviton is localized near the brane, but the majority of the
infinite bulk away from the brane where the warp factor diverges does not see
four-dimensional gravity. A naive application of the holographic principle from
the point of view of the four-dimensional observer would lead to a paradox; a
global holographic mapping would require infinite entropy density. In this
paper, we show that this paradox is resolved by the proper covariant
formulation of the holographic principle. This is the first explicit example of
a time-independent metric for which the spacelike formulation of the
holographic principle is manifestly inadequate. Further confirmation of the
correctness of this approach is that light-rays leaving the brane intersect at
the location where we expect four-dimensional gravity to no longer dominate. We
also present a simple method of locating CFT excitations dual to a particle in
the bulk. We find that the holographic image on the brane moves off to infinity
precisely when the particle exits the brane's holographic domain. Our analysis
yields an improved understanding of the physics of the AdS_4/AdS_5 model."

nonperturbative contribution to the superpotential from open-membrane instanton
in Heterotic M-Theory, we evaluate systematically the contribution to the
superpotential of a membrane instanton obtained by wrapping of a single M2
brane, once, on an isolated supersymmetric 3-cycle in a G_2-holonomy manifold.
We then try to relate the results obtained to those sketched out in Harvey and
Moore. We also do a heat-kernel asymptotics analysis to see whether one gets
similar UV-divergent terms for (one or both of) the bosonic and fermionic
determinants indicative of (partial) cancelation among them. The answer is in
the affirmative, as expected by the supersymmetry of the starting membrane
action. This work is a first step, both, in extending the work of Harvey and
Moore to the evaluation of nonperturbative superpotentials for non-rigid
supersymmetric 3-cycle wrappings, and in understanding the large N
Chern-Simons/closed type-A topological string theory duality of Gopakumar and
Vafa from M theory point of view."

in a general space-time dimension from the viewpoint of field theory. It is
shown that spin 0 and 2 fields are localized on a defect with the exponentially
decreasing warp factor. Spin 1 field can be also localized on a defect with the
exponentially decreasing warp factor. On the other hand, spin one-half and
three-half fields can be localized on a defect with the exponentially
increasing warp factor, provided that additional interactions are not
introduced. Thus, some mechanism of localization must be invoked for these
fermionic fields. These results are very similar to those of a domain wall in
five space-time dimensions except the case of spin 1 field."

in three dimensions, formulated using the Parisi large-N approach and a
modified dimensional-regularization technique. Bosons are associated with
composite operators and their propagators are dynamically generated by fermion
bubbles. Renormalization-group flows between pairs of interacting fixed points
satisfy a set of non-perturbative g <-> 1/g dualities. There is an exact
relation between the beta function and the anomalous dimension of the composite
boson. Non-Abelian gauge fields have a non-renormalized and quantized gauge
coupling, although no Chern-Simons term is present. A problem of the naive
dimensional-regularization technique for these theories is uncovered and
removed with a non-local, evanescent, non-renormalized kinetic term. The models
are expected to be a fruitful arena for the study of odd-dimensional conformal
field theory."

treated as the reduced system arising in a Drinfeld-Sokolov type Hamiltonian
symmetry reduction applied to a Poisson submanifold in the dual of the Lie
algebra $\widehat{gl}_{pr}\otimes {\Complex}[\lambda, \lambda^{-1}]$. Here a
series of extensions of this matrix Gelfand-Dickey system is derived by means
of a generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction defined for the Lie algebra
$\widehat{gl}_{pr+s}\otimes {\Complex}[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$ using the natural
embedding $gl_{pr}\subset gl_{pr+s}$ for $s$ any positive integer. The
hierarchies obtained admit a description in terms of a $p\times p$ matrix
pseudo-differential operator comprising an $r$-KdV type positive part and a
non-trivial negative part. This system has been investigated previously in the
$p=1$ case as a constrained KP system. In this paper the previous results are
considerably extended and a systematic study is presented on the basis of the
Drinfeld-Sokolov approach that has the advantage that it leads to local Poisson
brackets and makes clear the conformal ($\cal W$-algebra) structures related to

initial singularity problem. The space-time geometry has an unconventional
time-like singularity on a lower dimensional hypersurface, with localized
energy density. The natural interpretation of this singularity in string theory
is that of negative tension branes, for example the orientifolds of type II
string theory. Space-time ends at the orientifolds, and it is divided in three
regions: a contracting region with a future cosmological horizon; an
intermediate region which ends at the orientifols; and an expanding region
separated from the intermediate region by a past cosmological horizon. We study
the geometry near the singularity of the proposed cosmological scenario in a
specific string model. Using D-brane probes we confirm the interpretation of
the brane singularity as an orientifold. The boundary conditions on the
orientifolds and the past/future transition amplitudes are well defined.
Assuming the trivial vacuum in the past, we derive a thermal spectrum in the
future."

field theory ones. From the basic objects in both contexts the quantities
leading to knot and link invariants are introduced and analyzed. The quantum
field theory approaches that have been developed to compute these quantities
are reviewed. Perturbative approaches lead to Vassiliev or finite type
invariants. Non-perturbative ones lead to polynomial or quantum group
invariants. In addition, a brief discussion on open problems and future
developments is included."

is considered. Although such theories are free of ultraviolet divergences, they
still violate unitarity while in a usual field theory such a violation occurs
when the theory is nonrenormalizable. The compactness of space-like coordinates
implies discreteness of the time variable which leads to appearance of
unphysical modes and violation of unitarity even in the absence of a
star-product in the interaction terms. Thus, this conclusion holds also for
other quantum field theories with discrete time. Violation of causality, among
others, occurs also as the nonvanishing of the commutation relations between
observables at space-like distances with a typical scale of noncommutativity.
While this feature allows for a possible violation of the spin-statistics
theorem, such a violation does not rescue the situation but makes the scale of
causality violation as the inverse of the mass appearing in the considered
model, i.e., even more severe. We also stress the role of smearing over the
noncommutative coordinates entering the field operator symbols."

quantum black hole physics. The black holes on a brane in an AdS$_{D+1}$
braneworld that solve the classical bulk equations are interpreted as duals of
{\it quantum-corrected} $D$-dimensional black holes, rather than classical
ones, of a conformal field theory coupled to gravity. We check this explicitly
in D=3 and D=4. In D=3 we reinterpret the existing exact solutions on a flat
membrane as states of the dual 2+1 CFT. We show that states with a sufficiently
large mass really are 2+1 black holes where the quantum corrections dress the
classical conical singularity with a horizon and censor it from the outside. On
a negatively curved membrane, we reinterpret the classical bulk solutions as
quantum-corrected BTZ black holes. In D=4 we argue that the bulk solution for
the brane black hole should include a radiation component in order to describe
a quantum-corrected black hole in the 3+1 dual. Hawking radiation of the
conformal field is then dual to classical gravitational bremsstrahlung in the
AdS$_5$ bulk."

embedded in the background of a smooth domain wall interpolating between AdS
and Minkowski minima. Since the volume of the transverse dimension is infinite,
bulk supersymmetry is intact even if brane supersymmetry is completely broken.
On the other hand, in this setup unbroken bulk supersymmetry is incompatible
with non-zero brane cosmological constant, so the former appears to protect the
latter. In this paper we point out that, to have a consistent coupling between
matter localized on the brane and bulk gravity, in this setup generically it
appears to be necessary that the brane world-volume theory be conformal. Thus,
unbroken bulk supersymmetry appears to actually protect not only the
cosmological constant but also conformal invariance on the brane."

an ideal test ground for the string theory methods. Depending on a particular
choice of the boundary operator S-branes may be commutative or non-commutative.
We demonstrate that projection of the B-field on the brane directions (i.e. on
the components which actually influence the boundary conditions) is done with
the help of the chirality operator. We show that the T-duality transformation
maps an S-brane to another S-brane. At the expense of introducing non-local
interactions in the bulk we construct also a duality transformation between

theories, extending previous investigations on scalar field theories to the
gauge case where non-locality mingles with the presence of unphysical states.
We concentrate our efforts on two different aspects of the problem. We start by
discussing the analytical structure of the vacuum polarization tensor, showing
how Cutkoski's rules and positivity of the spectral function are realized when
non-commutativity does not affect the temporal coordinate. When instead
non-commutativity involves time, we find the presence of extra troublesome
singularities on the $p_0^2$-plane that seem to invalidate the perturbative
unitarity of the theory. The existence of new tachyonic poles, with respect to
the scalar case, is also uncovered. Then we turn our attention to a different
unitarity check in the ordinary theories, namely time exponentiation of a
Wilson loop. We perform a $O(g^4)$ generalization to the (spatial)
non-commutative case of the familiar results in the usual Yang-Mills theory. We
show that exponentiation persists at $O(g^4)$ in spite of the presence of Moyal
phases reflecting non-commutativity and of the singular infrared behaviour
induced by UV/IR mixing."

Symplectic Ensemble (chSE), corresponding to any number of colors and fermions

closed formulas for the scalar kernels from which all spectral correlation
functions of the chGOE and chGSE can be determined. Moreover, we obtain
complete analytic expressions of such correlators in the double microscopic

symmetric scalar field theories are studied to leading order in the derivative
expansion. The Gaussian fixed point is examined for d>2 dimensions and
arbitrary infrared regularisation. The Wilson-Fisher fixed point in d=3 is
studied using an optimised flow. We compute critical exponents and subleading
corrections-to-scaling to high accuracy from the eigenvalues of the stability
matrix at criticality for all N. We establish that the optimisation is
responsible for the rapid convergence of the flow and polynomial truncations
thereof. The scheme dependence of the leading critical exponent is analysed.
For all N > 0, it is found that the leading exponent is bounded. The upper
boundary is achieved for a Callan-Symanzik flow and corresponds, for all N, to
the large-N limit. The lower boundary is achieved by the optimised flow and is
closest to the physical value. We show the reliability of polynomial
approximations, even to low orders, if they are accompanied by an appropriate
choice for the regulator. Possible applications to other theories are outlined."

of related theories are obtained by adding extra SU(k) factors with
bifundamental matter and by turning on masses to flow down to various
asymptotically free theories. The N=4 supersymmetric SU(k) theory can be
embedded in these asymptotically free theories, allowing a derivation of a
subgroup of its S duality group as an exact equivalence of quantum field
theories."

charged, gravitating, massive higher spin fields. For spin s=3/2, making the
metric dynamical yields improved causality bounds. These involve only the mass,
the product eM_P of the charge and Planck mass and the cosmological constant
\Lambda. The bounds are themselves related to a gauge invariance of the
timelike component of the field equation at the onset of acausality. While
propagation is causal in arbitrary E/M backgrounds, the allowed mass ranges of
parameters are of Planck order. Generically, interacting spins s>3/2 are
subject to DoF violations as well as to acausality; the former must be overcome
before analysis of the latter can even begin. Here we review both difficulties
for charged s=2 and show that while a g-factor of 1/2 solves the DoF problem,

conformal currents in Minkowski spacetime. The charges have a form of integrals
of $M$-forms which are bilinear in the field variables and are closed as a
consequence of the field equations. Conservation implies independence of a
value of charge of a local variation of a $M$-dimensional integration surface
$\Sigma \subset \M_M$ analogous to Cauchy surface in the usual spacetime. The
scalar conserved charge provides an invariant bilinear form on the space of
solutions of the field equations that gives rise to a positive definite norm on
the space of quantum states."

backgrounds. We calculate the leading corrections to the boundary conformal
field theory involving the background fields, and in particular we study the
correlation functions of the resulting system. This allows us to obtain the
world-volume deformation, identifying the open string metric and the
noncommutative deformation parameter. The picture that unfolds is the
following: when the gauge invariant combination \omega = B + F is constant one
obtains the standard Moyal deformation of the brane world-volume. Similarly,
when d\omega = 0 one obtains the noncommutative Kontsevich deformation,
physically corresponding to a curved brane in a flat background. When the
background is curved, H = d\omega \not= 0, we find that the relevant algebraic
structure is still based on the Kontsevich expansion, which now defines a
nonassociative star product with an A_\infty homotopy associative algebraic
structure. We then recover, within this formalism, some known results of Matrix
theory in curved backgrounds. In particular, we show how the effective action
obtained in this framework describes, as expected, the dielectric effect of
D-branes. The polarized branes are interpreted as a soliton, associated to the
condensation of the brane gauge field."

noncompact target spaces as applied to string theory. Standard CFT results get
corrected by boundary terms in the target space in a way consistent with the
expected spacetime physics. For instance, one-point functions of general
operators on the sphere and boundary operators on the disk need not vanish; we
show that they are instead equal to boundary terms in spacetime. By applying
this result to vertex operators for spacetime gauge transformations with
support at infinity, we derive formulas for conserved gauge charges in string
theory. This approach provides a direct CFT definition of ADM energy-momentum
in string theory."

play a vital role in cosmology. In particular, in a spacetime with toroidal
spatial hypersurfaces, the dynamics of the winding modes may help yield three
large spatial dimensions. However, toroidal compactifications are
phenomenologically unrealistic. In this paper we therefore take a first step
toward extending these cosmological considerations to $D$-dimensional toroidal
orbifolds. We use numerical simulation to study the timescales over which
""pseudo-wound"" strings unwind on these orbifolds with trivial fundamental
group. We show that pseudo-wound strings can persist for many ``Hubble times''
in some of these spaces, suggesting that they may affect the dynamics in the
same way as genuinely wound strings. We also outline some possible extensions
that include higher-dimensional wrapped branes."

In this paper, the
non-commutativity in string theory is reviewed. At first we review that a
Dp-brane is equivalent to a configuration of infinitely many D($p-2$)-branes.
If we consider the worldvolume as that of the Dp-brane, coordinates of the
Dp-brane is commutative. On the other hand if we deal with the worldvolume as
that of the D($p-2$)-branes, since coordinates of many D-branes are promoted to
matrices the worldvolume theory is non-commutative one. Next we see that using
a point splitting reguralization gives a non-commutative D-brane, and a
non-commutative gauge field can be rewritten in terms of an ordinary gauge
field. The transformation is called the Seiberg-Witten map. And we introduce
second class constraints as boundary conditions of an open string. Since
Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are mixed in the constraints when the
open string is coupled to a NS B field, the end points of the open string is
non-commutative."

the hot big bang singularity. A key question they face is whether there exists
a unique prescription for following perturbations through the bounce, an issue
which is not yet definitively settled. This goal of this paper is more modest,
namely to study a bouncing Universe model in which neither General Relativity
nor the Weak Energy Condition is violated. We show that a perturbation which is
pure growing mode before the bounce does not match to a pure decaying mode
perturbation after the bounce. Analytical estimates of when the comoving
curvature perturbation varies around the bounce are given. It is found that in
general it is necessary to evaluate the evolution of the perturbation through
the bounce in detail rather than using matching conditions."

It allows to
anticipate the matching of continuous and discrete global anomalies, and can be
applied at field configurations where the gauge group is not necessarily
completely broken. The theorem is used to show that discrete anomaly matching
is mathematically unrelated to continuous anomaly matching and thus offer a
truly independent test on a given spectrum. It is also applied to the wide
class of theories with unconstrained basic gauge invariants, including theories
with an affine moduli space and theories in a Coulomb phase, for which an
interesting connection is found between anomaly matching and the geometry of
the null-cone, the union set of orbits of the complexified gauge group $G^c$
having zero in its boundary. The existence of $G^c$ orbits of maximum dimension
in the null-cone implies the matching of continuous anomalies (between the
elementary fields and the basic invariants), whereas the distance to the origin
of weight space of a hyperplane containing the weights of a point in such an
orbit determines the matching of discrete anomalies. The examples worked out in
detail are SO(N) with a symmetric tensor, SO(N) with (N-4) vectors, the ISS
model, SO(N) with (N-3) vectors, and the Seiberg Witten theories, one flavor of
matter in the adjoint of a simple gauge group."

investigated by Cai, Myung and Zhang. In the current study, we begin by showing
that the brane evolution is described by Friedmann-like equations for radiative
matter. Next, on the basis of the dS/CFT correspondence, we identify the
thermodynamic properties of the brane universe. We then demonstrate that many
(if not all) of the holographic aspects of analogous AdS-bulk scenarios
persist. These include a (generalized) Cardy-Verlinde form for the CFT entropy
and various coincidences when the brane crosses the cosmological horizon."

has different unitary representations related among themselves through unitary
U(2) transformations. In particular the SU(2) transformations are generated by
the spin-like operators constructed with the help of the same covariantly
constant Killing-Yano tensors which generate Dirac-type operators. A parity
operator is defined and some explicit transformations which connect the
Dirac-type operators among themselves are given. These transformations form a
discrete group which is a realization of the quaternion discrete group. The
fifth Dirac operator constructed using the non-covariant Killing-Yano tensor of
the Taub-NUT space is quite special. This non-standard Dirac operator is

scenarios are considered in which visible sector Standard Model fields are
confined on a brane, with hidden sector supersymmetry breaking isolated on a
distant brane. In calculable examples with an internal manifold of any volume
the Kahler potential generically contains brane--brane non-derivative contact
interactions coupling the visible and hidden sectors and is not of the no-scale
sequestered form. This leads to non-universal scalar masses and without
additional assumptions about flavor symmetries may in general induce dangerous
sflavor violation even though the Standard Model and supersymmetry branes are
physically separated. Deviations from the sequestered form are dictated by bulk
supersymmetry and can in most cases be understood as arising from exchange of
bulk supergravity fields between branes or warping of the internal geometry.
Unacceptable visible sector tree-level tachyons arise in many models but may be
avoided in certain classes of compactifications. Anomaly mediated and gaugino
mediated contributions to scalar masses are sub-dominant except in special

charge $Q$ of the conventional PS formalism is promoted to a bona fide
nilpotent charge $\hat{Q}$, the cohomology of which is equivalent to the
constrained cohomology of $Q$. This construction requires only a minimum number
(five) of additional fermionic ghost-antighost pairs and the vertex operators
for the massless modes of open string are obtained in a systematic way.
Furthermore, we present a simple composite ""$b$-ghost"" field $B(z)$ which
realizes the important relation $T(z) = \{\hat{Q}, B(z)\} $, with $T(z)$ the
Virasoro operator, and apply it to facilitate the construction of the

solution with mass equaling angular momentum. For AdS_3 X S^3 we are led to
consider three special families of metrics with this property: metrics with
conical defects, Aichelburg-Sexl type metrics generated by rotating particles,
and metrics generated by giant gravitons. We find that the first two of these
are special cases of the complete family of chiral primary metrics which can be
written down using the general solution in hep-th/0109154, but they correspond
to two extreme limits - the conical defect metrics map to CFT states generated
by twist operators that are all identical, while the Aichelburg-Sexl metrics
yield a wide dispersion in the orders of these twists. The giant graviton
solutions in contrast do not represent configurations of the D1-D5 bound state;
they correspond to fragmenting this system into two or more pieces. We look at
the large distance behavior of the supergravity fields and observe that the
excitation of these fields is linked to the existence of dispersion in the
orders and spins of the twist operators creating the chiral primary in the CFT."

the fact that the low-energy $s(j=0)$-wave absorption cross section for a
massless scalar is given by the area of the cosmological horizon. On the other

The NS and NS~ boundary states are related by a Z_2 ""spin-reversal""
transformation. We treat the tricritical Ising model as an example, and in an
appendix we discuss the (non-superconformal) case of the Ising model."

scalar fields with negative kinetic energy coupled to gravity without a
cosmological constant are considered. It is shown that in the presence of an
ordinary fluid, any solution of the vacuum Einstein equations with cosmological
constant is a solution provided $\rho-P={\Lambda \over 4 \pi G}$. The solutions
can be interpreted as a steady state in which matter or entropy is being
continuously created (or destroyed). The motion of the matter is not determined
by the background Einstein spacetime, many different matter flows can be found
giving rise to the same metric. Solutions without ordinary matter are also
considered. Anti-gravitating multi-solutions and repulsive solutions which can

orbifolds and compactifications with fluxes. Inequivalent compactifications are
classified by conjugacy classes of the U-duality group and result in gauged
supergravities in lower dimensions with nontrivial Scherk-Schwarz potentials on
the moduli space. For certain twists, this mechanism is equivalent to
introducing internal fluxes but is more general and can be used to stabilize
some of the moduli. We show that the potential has stable minima with zero
energy precisely at the fixed points of the twist group. In string theory, when
the twist belongs to the T-duality group, the theory at the minimum has an
exact CFT description as an orbifold. We also discuss more general twists by
nonperturbative U-duality transformations."

sector spectra of open strings to include cases with nonzero flat B fields. In
such cases, D-branes are no longer well-modelled precisely by sheaves, but
rather they are replaced by `twisted' sheaves, reflecting the fact that gauge
transformations of the B field act as affine translations of the Chan-Paton
factors. As in previous work, we find that the massless boundary Ramond sector
states are counted by Ext groups -- this time, Ext groups of twisted sheaves.
As before, the computation of BRST cohomology relies on physically realizing
some spectral sequences. Subtleties that cropped up in previous work also
appear here."

a nontrivial background in the case of 1+1-(supersymmetric) solitons. In
particular we study and compare the commonly employed regularization methods
(mode- energy/momentum- cutoff and derivative regularization). We show that the
main point for a consistent regularization/renormalization is to find a
relation between the ``cutoffs'' in the vacuum and the nontrivial sector so
that they can be related in a consistent manner. For each scheme we give a
principle to derive this relation and to perform calculations in a consistent
way. These principles are simple and not restricted to two dimensions or

in the bulk. We derive an expression for the gauge theory operator dual to the
bulk graviton, both in bosonic string theory and superstring theory. In either
case, we find that the coupling is different from what was expected in the
literature when the graviton is polarized in the noncommutative directions. In
the case of superstring, the expression for the energy-momentum tensor is
consistent with the way the bulk metric appears in the action for the
noncommutative gauge theory. We also clarify some aspects of the correspondence
between operators in the gauge theory and boundary conditions in the dual
gravitational description."

strengths and potentials, along with those of the space-time supersymmetry
parameters, the gravitinos and the dilatinos in type-II theories. The results
include the case when the SO(d,d) transformation involves the time direction.
The derivation is based on the compatibility of SO(d,d) transformations with
space-time supersymmetry, which automatically guarantees compatibility with the
equations of motion. It involves constructing the spinor representation of a
twist that an SO(d,d) action induces between the local Lorentz frames
associated with the left- and right-moving sectors of the worldsheet theory.

at finite temperature $T$ is equivalent to a one-dimensional Coulomb gas of
charged particles at the same $T$. This equivalence is then used to explore the
phase structure of the massive Thirring model. For strong coupling and $T>>m$
(the fermion mass) the system is shown to behave as a free gas of ""molecules""
(charge pairs in the Coulomb gas terminology) made of pairs of chiral
condensates. This binding of chiral condensates is responsible for the
restoration of chiral symmetry as $T\to\infty$. In addition, when a fermion
chemical potential $\mu\neq 0$ is included, the analogy with a Coulomb gas
still holds with $\mu$ playing the role of a purely imaginary external electric
field. For small $T$ and $\mu$ we find a typical massive Fermi gas behaviour
for the fermion density, whereas for large $\mu$ it shows chiral restoration by
means of a vanishing effective fermion mass. Some similarities with the chiral
properties of low-energy QCD at finite $T$ and baryon chemical potential are
discussed."

summarized briefly. The stability of dS/AdS-Schwarzschild black strings has
been investigated. Interestingly, the AdS-Schwarzschild black strings turn out
to be stable as the horizon size becomes larger than the AdS scale. It is also
shown that BTZ black strings in four dimensions are stable regardless of the
horizon size. Such stable feature seems to be common for several known black
strings in dimensions lower than five. Some implications of our results on the

descriptions of six-dimensional field theories realized on the worldvolume of
(p,q) five-branes (OD5 theory). We show that in order for the low-energy gauge
theory description to be valid the theta parameter must be rational. Irrational
values of theta require a strongly coupled string description of the system at
low-energy. We discuss the phase structure and deduce some properties of these
theories. In the second part we construct and study the supergravity
description of NS5-branes with two electric RR field, which provides a dual

the identification of the proper hull boundary states. This allows us to define
an infinite set of SLE zero modes, or martingales, whose existence is a
consequence of the existence of a null vector in the appropriate Virasoro
modules. This identification leads, for instance, to linear systems for
generalized crossing probabilities whose coefficients are multipoint CFT

functions and probabilities of stopping time events in SLE evolutions. We point

independent off-shell string theory. The major obstacle in doing so is that
renormalization conditions of the underlying world-sheet theories are not
exactly known. To get some insight, we first consider the tachyon and gauge
field backgrounds and carry out computations in different renormalization
schemes for both, bosonic string and superstring. Next, we use a principle of
universality (renormalization scheme independence) to somehow compensate the
missing of the renormalization conditions and get information we are looking
for. It turns out that some asymptotics which are responsible for the
potentials only obey the principle of universality."

geometric manner and use this to obtain an Ansatz for the M-theory flow. We are
able to generalize our solution further to obtain flows with del Pezzo
sub-manifolds, and we give an explicit solution with a conifold singularity."

Genuine BPS states form shortened multiplets of dimension two. In the models we
consider there are two degenerate shortened multiplets at the classical level,
but there is no obstruction to pairing up through quantum tunneling. The
tunneling amplitude in the imaginary time is described by instantons. We find
that the instanton is nothing but the 1/4 BPS saturated ``wall junction,''
considered previously in the literature in other contexts. Two central charges
of the superalgebra allow us to calculate the instanton action without finding
the explicit solution (it is checked, though, numerically, that the saturated
solution does exist). We present a quantum-mechanical interpretation of the
soliton tunneling."

localized gravity, bulk fermions and scalars often have bound states with zero
4-dimensional mass. In this way massless matter residing on the brane may be
obtained. We consider what happens when one tries to introduce small, but
non-vanishing mass to these matter fields. We find that the discrete zero modes
turn into quasi-localized states with finite 4-dimensional mass and finite
width. The latter is due to tunneling of massive matter into extra dimension.
We argue that this phenomenon is generic to fields that can have bulk modes. We
also point out that in theories meant to describe massive scalars, the
4-dimensional scalar potential has, in fact, power-law behavior at large

a hierarchical pattern of the symmetry breaking: G->U(1) at V->nothing at v,
V>>v. While in the low-energy limit the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string (flux
tube) is perfectly stable, being considered in the full theory it is
metastable. We consider the simplest example: the magnetic flux tubes in the
SU(2) gauge theory with adjoint and fundamental scalars. First, the adjoint
scalar develops a vacuum expectation value V breaking SU(2) down to U(1). Then,
at a much lower scale, the fundamental scalar (quark) develops a vacuum
expectation value v creating the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string. (We also
consider an alternative scenario in which the second breaking, U(1)->nothing,
is due to an adjoint field.) We suggest an illustrative ansatz describing an
""unwinding"" in SU(2) of the winding inherent to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen
strings in U(1). This ansatz determines an effective 2D theory for the unstable
mode on the string world-sheet. We calculate the decay rate (per unit length of
the string) in this ansatz and then derive a general formula. The decay rate is
exponentially suppressed. The suppressing exponent is proportional to the ratio
of the monopole mass squared to the string tension, which is quite natural in
view of the string breaking through the monopole-antimonopole pair production.
We compare our result with the one given by Schwinger's formula dualized for
describing the monopole-antimonopole pair production in the magnetic field."

Following [1], we construct a projective unitary representation of pi_1(Sigma)
realized on L^2(H), with H the upper half-plane. As a first step we introduce a
suitably gauged sl_2(R) algebra. Then a uniquely determined gauge connection
provides the central extension which is a 2-cocycle of the 2nd Hochschild
cohomology group. Our construction is the double-scaling limit N\to\infty,
k\to-\infty of the representation considered in the Narasimhan-Seshadri
theorem, which represents the higher-genus analog of 't Hooft's clock and shift
matrices of QCD. The concept of a noncommutative Riemann surface Sigma_\theta
is introduced as a certain C^\star-algebra. Finally we investigate the Morita
equivalence."

3-fold $X$ the low energy dynamics is that of a black string in 5 dimensional
$\CN=1$ supergravity. The infrared dynamics on the string worldsheet is an $\CN
= (0,4)$ 2D conformal field theory. Assuming the 2D CFT can be described as a
nonlinear sigma model, we describe the target space geometry of this model in
terms of the data of $X$ and $\CP$. Variations of weight two Hodge structures
enter the construction of the model in an interesting way."
